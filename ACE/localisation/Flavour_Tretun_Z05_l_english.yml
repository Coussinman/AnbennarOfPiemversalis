 Z05_north_title:0 "Reconquest of Roilsard"
 Z05_north_desc:0 "Roilsard occupies a critical position in the Bay of Wines, serving as a nexus of fertile lands, a bustling trading port, and the meeting point between Lencenor and the Empire. This vital region, once apart of our kingdom, was unjustly taken from us during the partition by invaders. It's reclamation is not merely a matter of pride but of strategic necessity, securing our economic future and reinforcing our presence in the region."

 Z05_restore_prosperity_title:0 "Tretunic Prosperity"
 Z05_restore_prosperity_desc:0 "To restore the Tretunic glory of old, we must turn our focus to the revitalization of our core lands. The countryside, the lifeblood of our realm, holds the key to our resurgence.

 Z05_tretunic_title:0 "Tretuouni Resurgence"
 Z05_tretunic_desc:0 "After the partition of Tretun and the scattering of our people, the proud Tretunic culture has waned, eroded by the influence of the Pearlsedgers. Yet, with the renewed prosperity of our nation, we have an opportunity to reignite the flame of our heritage. It is our duty to revive the old customs and traditions that once defined us. Through festivals, art, literature, and education, the Tretunic culture must be restored to its former glory, serving as a symbol of our resilience and a testament to our identity."

 Z05_carneter_title:0 "Restore Carneter"
 Z05_carneter_desc:0 "Though the Carnetori have been our traditional foes, the time has come to set aside old grievances and unite against a greater threat. Together, we will drive the invaders back to the sea and reclaim the lands that once belonged to the Carnetori. As a gesture of unity and respect, we will reintroduce Carnetori customs to these territories, honoring their heritage and fostering a new bond between our peoples. While the past is marked by conflict, the future will see us moving forward as allies, bound by a shared purpose and mutual respect."

 Z05_olifants_title:0 "Sound the Olifants"
 Z05_olifants_desc:0 "Enough is enough! The Tretunic people have endured the yoke of foreign oppressors for far too long. The Rubenairey Duke’s rule has stifled our spirit and stolen our sovereignty. But no more! The Olifants will sound across our hills and valleys, rallying all true Tretunics to the cause. It is time to rise as one, cast off the chains of subjugation, and reclaim our independence. Our freedom and glory await—let the call to arms echo through the land!"

 Z05_shackles_title:0 "Resurgent Tretun"
 Z05_shackles_desc:0 "Tretun stands free and independent once more, but freedom alone is not enough. The Pearlmen continue to defile our ancestral lands, their presence a stain on Tretunic soil. Meanwhile, our rightful holdings in Roilsard remain fragmented, scattered among rival realms. We cannot allow this division to persist. The time has come to rally our strength and reclaim what is ours by right—every hill, every field, every harbor. Let the Tretunic banners rise again as we march to restore the full glory of our homeland!"

 Z05_tretunic_dawn_title:0 "Tretunic Dawn"
 Z05_tretunic_dawn_desc:0 "The unthinkable has been achieved, the Tretunic people have risen from the ashes of defeat and reclaimed their rightful place in the world. The Pearlmen, who once oppressed and divided us, have been driven back into the sea, and the lands that were stolen from us now fly the Tretunic banner once more. But this victory is not the end of our journey; it is only the beginning. Now, we must look to the future—to solidify our legacy, to rebuild and strengthen our realm, and to ensure that Tretun never falls again. Let this be the dawn of a new and glorious era for our people!"

 Z05_invaders_title:0 "War Against the Invaders"
 Z05_invaders_desc:0 "Though our lands have been reclaimed and the Tretunic banner flies high once more, the threats that loom over us cannot be ignored. The reavers may be vanquished, but they were not the only ones who carved away at the region now known as West Dameshead. Our old rivals, the Carnetori, have been displaced and remain a volatile force, while the imperialist Kingdom of Lorent expands its reach in the north, threatening our sovereignty and stability. We must not let our guard down; the time has come to fortify our defenses, rally our strength, and prepare to face these threats head-on."

 Z05_forward_title:0 "The Way Forward"
 Z05_forward_desc:0 "Victory is ours! The Damerians and Lorentish have been driven back, and Tretun stands strong, its position secured against those who sought to diminish us. Yet, even in triumph, our eyes must remain fixed on the horizon. The east, in the tumultuous lands of Escann, stirs with unrest. For now, we shall rest and rebuild, savoring the fruits of our hard-fought battles. But we cannot afford complacency, for the shifting tides of Escann may bring new challenges. The future of Tretun beckons, and we must be ready to seize it."

 Z05_religious_zeal_title:0 "Religious Zeal"
 Z05_religious_zeal_desc:0 "The way forward is clear, we must champion the Corinite faith and spread its teachings throughout our realm. We will help Corin in her holy war against Adean and his treacherous followers, and ensure that the light of righteousness shines brightly in our lands."

 Z05_defeat_traitor_title:0 "Defeat the Traitors"
 Z05_defeat_traitor_desc:0 "Adean and his followers dare to deny Corin her rightful place as ruler of the Court, an affront to the one who has stood as the shield of Cannor against annihilation. When the Greentide threatened to engulf all, it was Corin who led the charge, preserving our lands, our people, and our very existence. What has Adean done to compare to her sacrifice and leadership?\n\nThis betrayal cannot stand. Corin's honor, and the stability of the Court itself, demand that we act. We must rally to her side, stand against the traitors who have taken arms against her, and restore her rightful rule. To do nothing is to risk the collapse of all she has fought to protect.\n\nLet the traitors know that their treachery will not go unpunished. Corin's cause is just, her claim unassailable, and we will defend her with our lives if necessary. For Corin, and for the future of us all!"

 Z05_fight_empire_title:0 "The Fight for the Empire"
 Z05_fight_empire_desc:0 "There can be no peace while the Empire of Anbennar defies the truth that Corin is the rightful ruler of the Court. The Adeanics may have entrenched themselves within the Empire’s halls, but their hold is not unbreakable. We will not rest, nor falter, until their grip is pried loose and the Empire kneels in recognition of Corin's sovereignty."

 Z05_corinite_victory_title:0 "Corinite Victory"
 Z05_corinite_victory_desc:0 "The Adeanic heartlands of Lencenor have bent their knees and accepted the truth of the Corinite faith. The Empire of Anbennar has been humbled and lost to the Corinite Coalition. The time has come to celebrate our victory and the triumph of righteousness over heresy. Corin's light shines brightly over all of Cannor, and her faithful followers stand united in the face of adversity."

 Z05_pearlsedge_title:0 "Strike From the Hills"
 Z05_pearlsedge_desc:0 "The time of suffering is over. The Pearlsedgers, once reavers who ravaged our lands, thought they could break our spirit by forcing us into the desolate hills of Tretun. They thought they could erase us. But they were wrong.\n\nWe have endured in silence, waiting for the moment when we would rise again, stronger and more determined. That moment is now. From the hills where we were cast aside, we will strike with the fury of those long oppressed. The Pearlsedgers will feel our wrath as we reclaim our rightful lands.\n\nWe will take back our cities, our fields, our homes. Their legacy of destruction will be erased from the pages of history, and Tretun will once again shine as the proud, sovereign land it was always meant to be. Their time in our lands is over, and we will see them driven back into the sea, forgotten by all. Tretun will rise again."

 Z05_foreign_companies_title:0 "A Mercenary Kingdom"
 Z05_foreign_companies_desc:0 "Due to our weak position, we have relied on foreign mercenaries and adventurers to bolster our ranks. These companies have proven their worth time and time again, and we have grown dependent on their strength and loyalty. Even when we outgrow our need for them, they will always have a place in our realm, as honored allies and trusted comrades."

 Z05_redfort_title:0 "Restore Redfort"
 Z05_redfort_desc:0 "Redfort once stood as a powerful fortress and kingdom, they were once our northern rivals. But just as we have been, their lands were invaded and they were crushed beneath the heel of invaders. We will take the lands and restore it's fort."

 Z05_fleet_title:0 "Tretunic Fleet"
 Z05_fleet_desc:0 "We are surrounded by water countries with powerful fleets, if we are to survive we have to match them. The Tretunic fleet must be expanded and we have to show our enemies that these waters belong to us too."

 Z05_west_title:0 "Liberate Khasa"
 Z05_west_desc:0 "When the reavers descended upon our kingdom, slaying our king and nearly bringing Tretun to ruin, it was a Khasani mercenary captain who turned the tide. His unmatched valor drove the invaders away, saving us from subjugation. In gratitude, we crowned him as our king, forging a bond of kinship and loyalty with the Khasani people. Now, the time has come to repay this debt of honor. We must march to liberate their lands from gnollish tyranny and foreign meddling, ensuring that the Khasani once again stand free and sovereign."

 Z05_new_tretunica_title:0 "New Tretunica"
 Z05_new_tretunica_desc:0 "We have discovered a series of uninhabited islands, untouched by any native populations. This is a rare and golden opportunity for the Tretunic people—a chance to establish a new colony where our culture can thrive and our people can prosper. These islands will serve as a beacon of hope and resilience, ensuring the survival of Tretunic heritage no matter what challenges arise.\n\nIf fate ever turns against us, and we are invaded or driven from our homeland once more, this colony will stand as a refuge—a New Tretunica, safeguarded from the turmoil of the mainland. Let us seize this opportunity and secure a future for our people, no matter what storms may come."

 Z05_red_citadel_title:0 "The Red Citadel"
 Z05_red_citadel_desc:0 "Redfort occupies a critical position on the borders of Lencenor, a land rife with heresy and discord. Its location makes it the ideal stronghold for our forces—a defensive bulwark against threats and a launchpad for future campaigns.

 Z05_tretunic_empire_title:0 "Tretunic Empire"
 Z05_tretunic_empire_desc:0 "We have firmly established our presence across the vast oceans, securing our dominion over Aelantir and the surrounding seas. Tretunic fleets now patrol these waters, safeguarding vital trade routes and ensuring the steady flow of prosperity between our homeland and the colonies. Our settlements in distant lands are flourishing, with thriving markets and vibrant communities, and the proud Tretunic culture is extending its influence far beyond our shores.\n\nThis is no longer just a resurgence of our people—it is the dawn of a true Tretunic Empire, spanning oceans and continents."

 Z05_found_pearlsedge_title:0 "Found Corinhaven"
 Z05_found_pearlsedge_desc:0 "Pearlsedge, once the heart of the reavers who brought ruin to our lands, shall be transformed into a city of virtue and faith. Renamed Corinhaven, it will rise as a bastion of the Corinite faith, dedicated to honoring Corin and safeguarding her legacy. This city will become a sanctuary for imperial Corinite refugees, fleeing the tyranny of the Adeanic heretics, and a place where they can find safety, purpose, and hope."

 Z05_invite_faithful_title:0 "Invite the Faithful"

 Z05_adeans_faithful_title:0 "Defeat Adeans Faithful"
 Z05_adeans_faithful_desc:0 "With the thunderous charge of the Faithful, the Adeanic heretics will falter and their resolve will crumble. Our righteous warriors, guided by the light of the Corinite faith, will pierce their lines and shatter their unity. The Adeanic forces, unprepared to face the unyielding might of the Faithful, will scatter like leaves in a tempest."

 Z05_topple_adean_title:0 "Topple Adean"
 Z05_topple_adean_desc:0 "Battle after battle, the Adeanics crumble before our righteous might. Their faith falters, their resolve shatters, and their armies scatter like leaves in a storm. Each victory brings us closer to restoring the rightful order under Corin’s light. It is only a matter of time before these misguided fools are brought to their knees, and the true faith prevails over their hollow heresy."

 Z05_victory_over_lencenor_title:0 "Victory Over Lencenor"
 Z05_victory_over_lencenor_desc:0 "With one final push, Lencenor will be purged of the Adeanic heresy. Its misguided followers will learn the error of their ways, and the true light of Corin will shine across the land. Corin will be recognized as the rightful heir of the Court, her name honored where falsehood once reigned. As a fitting punishment for Adean's treachery, the grandest Adeanic temple will be consecrated anew—a majestic cathedral dedicated to Corin, symbolizing her ultimate triumph."
