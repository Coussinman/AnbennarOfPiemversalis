 AC7_blood_pact_title: "Blood Pact"
 AC7_blood_pact_desc: "The pack of Xanzerbexis finds itself in circumstances much like our own, experiencing a military revival and yet surrounded by enemies on all sides. To ensure our survival, we must forge an alliance of necessity. Together, we will devour the human foes who threaten our existence. A blood pact shall bind us, sealing our unity and ensuring that neither pack turns against the other."

 AC7_rule_by_might_title: "Rule By Might"
 AC7_rule_by_might_desc: "The pact between our packs has served us well, but it is time to assert our dominance. This might be seen as treacherous, but the weak should serve the strong and in this relationship, we are the stronger. We demand fealty from Xanzerbexis, and they will not dare to defy us."

 AC7_busiliar_title: "Slaughter the Lion"
 AC7_busiliar_desc: "Busilar looms as a formidable naval and land power, perched on the borders of Xanzerbexis, yet unaffiliated with the Empire's protection. This presents us with a rare and golden opportunity. Our packs will strike as one, Xanzerbexis descending from the hills with feral precision, while we emerge from the swamps to envelop them. Together, we will tear apart their armies and devour their pride. Our combined might shall bring down the lion, and our victory feast will be a testament to gnollish rise in Cannor."

 AC7_devour_the_isle_title: "Devour the Isle"
 AC7_devour_the_isle_desc: "The humans of Eborthil foolishly believe their island fortress and mighty fleets make them untouchable, that their naval dominance will shield them from harm. They cling to this delusion, but they are gravely mistaken. True terror will descend upon them when our relentless horde encircles their island, striking like a tempest from all sides. There will be no escape from the flames of our wrath; their ships will burn, their defenses will crumble, and their cries will echo unanswered as we devour everything they hold dear."

 AC7_destroy_dostanor_title: "Dostanorian Remains"
 AC7_destroy_dostanor_desc: "Dostanor is no more, its legacy reduced to ashes, yet a new realm has risen from its ruins to challenge us. Once, the mighty Third Xhaz was brought to a halt at the threshold of Dostanor’s heart, their crusade thwarted. But time has turned the tide. Now, we return as the heirs of the Third Xhaz, the flames of our destiny burning brighter than ever. We will not falter as they did—we will carve our path through Corvuria and finish what was begun. No force will stop us this time."

 AC7_threaten_the_empire_title: "Threaten the Empire"
 AC7_threaten_the_empire_desc: "A sickly green sky looms over the Empire, a harbinger of the storm to come. Beneath its ominous glow, the gnollish horde gathers—a fury that no walls can contain and no armies can repel. Soon, the Empire will face a terror unlike any other, a force that neither negotiates nor surrenders. We will descend upon them as a tide of fangs and claws, an unrelenting wave of destruction that will consume all in its path."

 AC7_bleed_the_wyvern_title: "Bleed the Wyvern"
 AC7_bleed_the_wyvern_desc: "The humans of Verne fancy themselves as mighty wyverns, soaring high above others with unassailable strength. But what will they do when their veins run dry and their pride is shattered? We will show them the truth of their clipped wings and dulled talons. Their cities will crumble under our assault, their fields will blaze in unquenchable fire, and their treasures will become the spoils of our horde."

 AC7_unite_the_tribes_title: "Unite the Tribes"
 AC7_unite_the_tribes_desc: "Only way for the Flamemarked Gnolls to rise to their rightful place is to unite the tribes under one banner. Kryzzar has taken the first steps, but the road ahead is long and treacherous. The other tribes will not bow easily, and the path to unity is fraught with danger. But Kryzzar is determined to see his vision through, no matter the cost."

 AC7_training_grounds_title: "Hyena Breeding"
 AC7_training_grounds_desc: "The swamps of the Folly are teeming with dangerous predators, and among its most fearsome inhabitants are the hyenas, descendants of those that accompanied the mighty horde of the Third Xhaz. These creatures, both feral and loyal to the gnolls, have served as mounts for generations, their speed and ferocity enhancing the mobility and power of our warriors. However, their numbers have dwindled over the years, posing a risk to our reliance on them in battle.\n\nTo secure the strength of our armies, we will establish a dedicated breeding ground for the hyenas within the depths of the swamp. Here, under the watchful eyes of skilled gnoll handlers, the population will be carefully replenished and raised to maturity."

 AC7_salt_the_earth_title: "Salt the Earth"
 AC7_salt_the_earth_desc: "Wherever the Flamemarked horde marches, it leaves nothing but devastation in its wake. Cities are reduced to smoldering rubble, and fertile fields are scorched to barren wastelands. The purpose of our conquest is not to claim or settle but to destroy and subjugate. We have no need for the fragile constructs of human civilization, their gilded halls, or their fragile harvests.\n\nThe people we capture are spared only to be enslaved, dragged back to the swamps of Daravan's Folly and the towering ziggurats of the Xhazobkult. There, they will labor ceaselessly for our war efforts, tending to the sacrificial pyres, and toiling in service of the horde until their bodies fail them. Their exhaustion and eventual demise are of no consequence; their lives serve only as fuel for our unstoppable advance."

 AC7_hellfire_title: "Hellfire"
 AC7_hellfire_desc: "The Ziggurat of Daravan's Folly stands as a symbol of our dominance, an imposing monument to the Xhazobkult and the strength of the Flamemarked Gnolls. Rising from the swamp's muck and shrouded in a haze of sulfur and smoke, it is the beating heart of our new empire. From here, we command the land, and from this holy site, our power will spread.\nWith the final conquest complete, it is time to solidify our control. The surviving humans, their spirits broken, are dragged to the foot of the Ziggurat. Their pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears. Their fate is sealed in the green hellfire of the sacrificial pyres. One by one, they are offered to the Xhazob, their souls consumed by the flames that illuminate the night sky.\n\nWhile the flames rage, the horde celebrates, reveling in the destruction and suffering they have wrought. The pack feasts on the spoils of war, their bloodlust sated for the moment. But there is no rest for the wicked. The orgies that follow are just as brutal and degenerative as the flames themselves, all acts of depravity designed to earn the favor of the Xhazob, to ensure that we remain favored by the demonic power that has fueled our rise."

 AC7_break_marches_title: "Break the Marches"
 AC7_break_marches_desc: "The Empire’s fortified borders stand as a fragile illusion of safety, a false sense of security that will soon crumble beneath the weight of our wrath. They believe that walls, strongholds, and steel can stop the unstoppable, that their fortresses can defend them from the might of the Flamemarked horde. But our recent conquests has shown us otherwise. Busilar and Eborthil, once proud and secure, thought themselves safe behind their defenses, only to be consumed by our relentless advance.\n\nNow, the Empire too will learn the bitter lesson of their arrogance. Their forts will fall as we strike from the swamps, from the hills, from every direction they thought they were safe. We know how to break their walls, their spirits, and their pride. No fortification, no matter how well-crafted, can stand against the fury of the Xhazobkult and the might of the Flamemarked."

 AC7_contact_cousins_title: "Contact With Our Cousins"
 AC7_contact_cousins_desc: "The swamps have served us well, but they are no longer enough. We, the descendants of the Third Xhaz, deserve more than these miserable, suffocating marshes. It is time to rise above the muck and claim what is rightfully ours. We must seek out the knowledge and power that lie beyond the swamp, to push the boundaries of our territory.\n\nThe Pact of Viakkoc holds the key to mastery over the seas, a domain we have long ignored, but which could open up vast opportunities for us.\n\nOur cousins in Bulwar and Salahad carry the remnants of our lost civilization, the knowledge of our ancestors who built great cities and empires. We will make contact, seek out the old secrets of gnollish architecture and civilization, and make the folly into a true gnollish realm."

 AC7_like_cattle_title: "Like Cattle In a Pen"
 AC7_like_cattle_desc: "The city of Nathalaire, an isolated island of sin and corruption, will soon feel the full wrath of our horde. It stands as a symbol of weakness, a nest of thieves and outcasts, and they think they are safe, tucked away in their fortress of stone. But they are wrong. The swamps that once shielded them from potential enemies from the mainland will now be their doom.\n\nThe city will burn and be turned into a sacrificial site for the Xhazob."

 AC7_swamp_ziggurat_title: "Great Swamp Ziggurat"
 AC7_swamp_ziggurat_desc: "The construction of a great Ziggurat in the heart of the Daravan's Folly will mark the beginning of our transformation and the rise of our power. Drawing inspiration from the grand traditions of our eastern cousins, we will build a monumental structure that stands as a testament to our strength, dominance, and unyielding will. It will be a symbol that strikes terror into the hearts of our enemies and declares to the world that the Flamemarked are no longer a scattered group of tribes—they are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe Ziggurat will rise from the swamp, an imposing structure of stone and copper that pierces the sky. Its vast, tiered platforms will be visible for miles, a constant reminder of our presence and might. We will gather the finest slaves—those captured in our raids and battles—and force them to work tirelessly in the mines and quarries, their backs bent and bodies broken under the strain of their labor. These slaves will toil in the harshest conditions, their efforts fueling the growth of our empire and the building of our monument to power.\n\nAs the Ziggurat takes shape, it will become a vital place in our society. It will not only serve as a place of worship, where we will offer sacrifices to the Xhazob, but it will also be a political and military center."

 AC7_last_castanorians_title: "Crumbling Remnants"
 AC7_last_castanorians_desc: "The crumbling remnants of the Castanorian dominion of Ourdia lie just beyond our borders, weakened by the relentless assault of goblin hordes. The once-proud dominion now teeters on the brink of collapse, its defenses shattered, and its people broken. It is only a matter of time before they fall, and we stand ready to hasten their inevitable demise."

 AC7_dwarf_slaves_title: "Dwarven Labor"
 AC7_dwarf_slaves_desc: "Securing skilled labor is paramount for the success of our plans for expansion, and what better craftsmen than the dwarves of Ovdal Tungr? The dwarves, known for their unparalleled skill in metalwork, stonecraft, and construction, will provide the labor necessary to build the infrastructure that will support our growing empire. Their expertise in crafting weapons, tools, and fortifications will ensure that our forces are always well-equipped and our strongholds unassailable.\n\nBut the value of Ovdal Tungr goes beyond its craftsmen. The strategic location of Ovdal Tungr in the mountains gives us a critical chokepoint, one that will secure our southern flank as we march towards Cannor. By taking control of the area, we will ensure that no force can easily approach our territory from the south."

 AC7_search_for_eggs_title: "Searching for Eggs"
 AC7_search_for_eggs_desc: "Some of our Vernmen slaves speak of wyvern eggs hidden deep in the mountains. Our warlocks believe they can use demonfire to hatch and tame them, turning these fierce creatures into deadly mounts for our armies."

 AC7_bane_of_wexonards_title: "Wexonard Bane"
 AC7_bane_of_wexonards_desc: "The Wexonards pride themselves on their supposed strength, claiming to be as unyielding and indestructible as iron. They speak of their warriors as if no enemy could ever challenge them, yet they have never faced an adversary like us. Our strength is not simply in numbers or brute force, but in our relentless determination, cunning strategies, and the fear we inspire in the hearts of our enemies. We will tear through their defenses, shatter their pride, and show them that no matter how strong they think they are, they are no match for the might of our horde."

 AC7_prospecting_our_swamp_title: "Prospecting our Swamps"
 AC7_prospecting_our_swamp_desc: "The swamps of Daravan's Folly, though treacherous and inhospitable, conceal within their depths a bounty of natural resources, most notably rich veins of copper. While the Flamemarked gnolls have long prioritized war and raiding over such endeavors, the potential of these resources cannot be ignored. Copper, a metal vital for weaponry, armor, and trade, holds the key to bolstering our war efforts and ensuring the continued dominance of our horde.\n\nTo this end, we will establish a system of mines throughout the swamps, utilizing the labor of slaves captured in raids and sacrifices deemed unworthy for the pyres of Xhazob. These mines will be harsh, efficient, and unrelenting, their yield serving the needs of the pack."

 AC7_crack_the_whips_title: "Crack the Whips"
 AC7_crack_the_whips_desc: "We must remind our slaves that their lives are forfeit, and that they exist only to serve the Xhazobkult. The crack of the whip and the lash of the overseer will be their constant companions, driving them to work harder, faster, and more efficiently. Those who falter will be punished"

 AC7_swamp_weed_title: "Swamp Weed"
 AC7_swamp_weed_desc: "A certain type of plant grows deep within the swamps of the Folly, a rare and peculiar species that, when smoked or consumed, induces powerful hallucinations and vivid visions. Our warlocks have discovered that this plant can also make it easier to contact demons, allowing us to tap into darker and more potent powers. This could prove to be a crucial advantage, granting us knowledge and strength beyond our mortal reach. Understanding its potential, we will cultivate and expand the growth of this plant, ensuring that our warlocks have a steady supply to deepen their connections with the demonic forces and harness their power for the glory of our horde."

 AC7_iron_ziggurat_title: "Iron Shackles Iron Ziggurat"
 AC7_iron_ziggurat_desc: "Just as we have raised a great ziggurat in the swamps of Daravan's Folly, a symbol of terror and our strength, so too shall we construct an monument in the mountains of Wexkeep. This towering structure will stand as a testament to our power, a mark of our dominance that will echo through the ages. The Cannorians will feel the weight of our presence, even if we one day fade from their lands. The ziggurat will be a reminder that our legacy will endure, that our flame will never be extinguished, and that we, the heirs of the Third Xhaz, have brought this region to heel. The Wexonards will built this ziggurat using their own proud iron mines, a fitting tribute to their defeat and our victory."

 AC7_towards_the_dragon_title: "Towards the Dragon"
 AC7_towards_the_dragon_desc: "Once, a mighty Xhazobine horde carved a path of destruction all the way to the heart of Castanor, bringing ruin and fear to all in their wake. They were only halted by the intervention of a black dragon, an enemy of great power that no one could have foreseen. Now, we shall avenge the Xhazobine and surpass all that they achieved. We will push farther, our horde stronger and more relentless than ever before. The heart of Castanor, where the Xhazobine fell, shall be the stage for our greatest conquest."

 AC7_the_heart_title: "The Heart"
 AC7_the_heart_desc: "The heart of the Castanorian Empire, once a beacon of power and glory, is now a desolate wasteland, a testament to the inevitable decay of empires. Castonath, the beating heart of that mighty empire, lies in ruins, its streets hollow and its great walls crumbled beneath the weight of the Greentide. The once-proud city is now a mere shadow of its former self, abandoned and forgotten.\n\nIt matters not who claims dominion over the shattered remnants of Castanor, for they will fall just as swiftly. The fires of conquest will consume them all, and Castonath, the symbol of their lost glory, will be reduced to ash. There is no salvation for this broken land; its fate is sealed by the unstoppable advance of our horde."

 AC7_empty_plains_title: "Empty Plains"
 AC7_empty_plains_desc: "The vast plains of western Castanor, once teeming with cattle and horses for the humans, will now serve a far darker purpose. Where the humans once raised their livestock, we shall raise our hyenas—fierce, bloodthirsty creatures that will be trained for war. These plains will become a breeding ground for our war beasts, where we will hone their savagery, teaching them to be even more ruthless, blood-soaked and relentless than ever before."

 AC7_avenge_dragonic_xhaz_title: "Revenge the Dragonic"
 AC7_avenge_dragonic_xhaz_desc: "The Dragonic Xhazobine will be avenged only when the ashes of Castanor's ancient heart are scattered across the land. The empire that once held so much power and pride will be nothing more than a smoldering ruin, its new inheabitants crushed beneath the weight of the Flamemarked Gnolls' fury.\n\nAs we march across the shattered remains of the empire, we will remind them that no one is safe from the wrath of our kind. Castanor's walls will crumble, its history will burn, and all those who know live under the protection of the white walls will fall. The flames of our vengeance will consume every last trace of the old empire, until only the charred bones of its people remain."

 AC7_esmaria_title: "Raze Esmaria"
 AC7_esmaria_desc: "Following the winding course of the River Esmar, our horde will carve a path of ruin through the heart of Esmaria. Their cities will be reduced to ash, their hallowed halls consumed by the flames of our wrath. Their boats will be torn apart and set ablaze, their charred remains drifting helplessly downriver as a warning to all who stand against us.\n\nThese soft, fragile people fancy themselves pillars of culture, but to us, they are nothing more than an obstacle—a fleeting roadblock on our march to glory. Their lands will be plundered, their treasures seized, and their legacies obliterated beneath the howl of the Flamemarked horde."

 AC7_river_of_blood_title: "River of Blood"
 AC7_river_of_blood_desc: "The cities that line the Luna River, proud and glistening with the wealth of the Empire, are but hollow monuments to vanity. Their opulence may dazzle the weak, but it will not save them from the relentless force of the Flamemarked. To us, their riches mean nothing more than offerings to the flames and tribute to the Xhazobine.\n\nWe will stain the waters of the Luna River red with the blood of their people, the currents carrying their despair as a grim hymn to our victory. Their glittering treasures will adorn our altars, their gilded halls reduced to smoldering ruins."

 AC7_the_greatest_pyre_title: "The Greatest Pyre"
 AC7_the_greatest_pyre_desc: "The heart of the Empire beckons, a grand and opulent prize ripe for the flames. Its towering spires, its storied halls, and its people steeped in imperial pride will serve as the ultimate offering to the Xhazob. The great city of Dameria, the jewel of the Empire, shall be consumed in an inferno so fierce that its embers will be seen from the farthest corners of Cannor.\n\nWe will raze its legacy to the ground, reducing its triumphs to ash and scattering its memories to the wind. The streets will run with fire and blood as the Xhazob's name echoes through the ruins.\n\nThis will be our moment of ascension, the culmination of our crusade. With Dameria obliterated, nothing will remain to oppose us—no army, no empire and no gods. We are the unstoppable flame, and the world will burn in our shadow."

 AC7_consuming_the_dragon_title: "Consuming the Dragon"
 AC7_consuming_the_dragon_desc: "Pretenders have squabbled over the shattered legacy of Castanor, their ambitions crumbling like the empires they sought to revive. Now, they all kneel beneath our dominion, their banners torn and their dreams extinguished. We are not here to restore the past or cling to faded glories—we are here to forge something greater, something unstoppable.\n\nOur empire will not echo the old ways; it will stand as a testament to unrelenting strength and the will of the Xhazob. Escann, once a defiant stronghold, will be consumed in green flames, its defiance turned to ash. These pyres will light the skies, a fiery proclamation of our conquest and a dire warning to those who might still resist.\n\nThe silver dragon, once the emblem of power, will bow before us—or be shattered beneath our claws. This is no restoration. This is a new order, one carved out with fire and blood, and it will endure long after the old empires are forgotten."

 AC7_the_dragon_ziggurat_title: "The Dragon Ziggurat"
 AC7_the_dragon_ziggurat_desc: "In the place where the Dragonic Xhazobine was felled, we shall place a monument to our victory. The Dragon Ziggurat will rise from the ashes of Castanor, a towering structure that will stand as a testament to our domination over the lands of the Silver Dragon."

flavor_kryzzar.1.t: "Rise of Kryzzar the Unifier"
flavor_kryzzar.1.d: "Kryzzar’s rise to power was swift and brutal. In a bloody clash of fangs and fury, he seized control from the aging matriarch, casting aside her vision in favor of his own ruthless path. The once-mighty kingdoms of Escann lie fractured and ripe for the taking, battered by the relentless advance of the Greentide and Ourdia lies broken from the relentless swarms of goblins. To Kryzzar, this chaos is not a threat, but an opportunity—a chance to lift the Flamemarked gnolls from the murky depths of the swamps, where they’ve skulked for generations, surviving only by the meager spoils of raids.\n\nNow, with ambition burning as fiercely as the burning marks on their flesh, Kryzzar dreams of a new era, where his kin need no longer scavenge like skulking wretches. The other tribes, mired in old feuds and short-sighted schemes, scoff at his bold claims, dismissing him as just another upstart. But that scorn will soon twist into fear. The Children of Xhazobine, emboldened and led with savage cunning, will rise from the heart of the folly and carve their dominance across the land. It is only a matter of time before all of Cannor trembles at the sight of the Flamemarked Gnolls once more."
flavor_kryzzar.1.a: "Glory to Kryzzar! Glory to the children of Xhazobine!"
AC7_guide: "To unite the folly, you need to use the §TPillage Country§! Peace option §Y3§! times using the §TFlamemarked Awakening§! §YCasus Belli§! and embrace §YFeudalism§!."

flavor_kryzzar.2.t: "The Fall of Eborthil"
flavor_kryzzar.2.d: "The gnollish brutes hauled the Silebor noble family through the shattered remains of the throne room in Eborthil, their cries for mercy echoing against the scorched walls. Their struggles were met only with rough laughter and snarls as they were thrown to the floor before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The once-magnificent chamber had become a ruin, draped in shadows and the eerie, flickering light of green flames from sacrificial pyres where other nobles screamed their last as they fed the fires.\n\nBut for the Silebor family, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had other intentions. A wicked grin split [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bloodstained muzzle as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] loomed over them. Ignoring their desperate pleas, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] began [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] grotesque ritual, slaughtering them one by one. Each act was deliberate, each moment drawn out as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] devoured their flesh, a vile ritual meant to bring the attention of the Xhazob. The air around the island is filled with the smell of burning flesh and the heckling of the gnolls."
flavor_kryzzar.2.a: "Yummers"

flavor_kryzzar.3.t: "Burning Out the Shadows"
flavor_kryzzar.3.d: "The gnolls surged through the shattered remnants of Dostanor, their rampage unstoppable until they reached the gates of Arca Corvur. There, the royal family of síl Vivin was dragged from their ancestral halls, their faces a blend of fear and forced composure. Pleas tumbled from their lips, promises of tribute, riches, and loyalty in exchange for their lives. Whispers of astonishment swept through the crowd as some revealed their dark secret: they were vampires, creatures of the night whose cunning and power could prove invaluable to [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nBut [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s expression twisted into a grin devoid of mercy as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] horde erupted into laughter. The flickering light of prepared pyres cast demonic shadows across the scene. \"Power from those who cower in darkness is no power at all,\" [Root.Monarch.GetName] spat, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice cold and final. The nobles’ cries were soon consumed by the roar of flames as they were cast into the fires, their promises and pride burned away in an instant.\n\nAs the last of the screams faded, the gnolls erupted into a fervent, chaotic celebration, their eyes reflecting the emerald glow of the sacrificial pyres. With the fall of Arca Corvur, the conquest of Dostanor was complete—a conquest that reclaimed the ground where their forebears had once been halted. Now, with fire and fury, they prepared to carve their path beyond the borders that had restrained them for generations."

flavor_kryzzar.5.d: "Due to our rabid expansion and conquest of the neighboring lands of the Empire, the border marches have decided to unite and build up their border defenses."
flavor_kryzzar.5.a: "We will break their walls!"

flavor_kryzzar.6.t: "The Unification"
flavor_kryzzar.6.d: "Kryzzar has achieved the unimaginable: for the first time since the third Xhazobine's bloody campaign, the Flamemarked gnolls stand united under a single banner. Thousands gather, eyes gleaming with savage reverence, as he sears a new pattern into his flesh—a testament to his claim as heir to the Xhazobine and supreme ruler of all Flamemarked. This rite binds his authority in fire and blood, leaving no doubt that a new age has dawned.\n\nSoon, what the Xhazobine left unfinished will be reborn in a storm of fury. Cannor will face an invasion not seen in generations, with green flames of sacrificial pyres scorching the heavens, a blazing signal of the gnolls’ relentless march. Cannor will tremble as the Flamemarked rise to carve their legend in flame and ash."
flavor_kryzzar.6.a: "Flame and Ash."

flavor_kryzzar.8.t: "The Preparation."
flavor_kryzzar.8.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]’s command swept through the conquered lands like wildfire: thousands of human subjects were to be rounded up and marched to the looming great ziggurat. In the festering heart of Dreadmire, slaves toiled day and night, clearing and preparing the site before the ziggurat, their shackled hands trembling as they worked. Fear hung thick in the air, laced with the acrid scent of sweat and mud.\n\nThe ritual to come would last 30 days—a month steeped in blood, agony, and frenzied revelry meant to draw the gaze of the Xhazob itself. Offerings and sacrifices would be made in relentless waves, accompanied by rites so profane they would make the stoutest soul recoil. The gnolls anticipated the descent into chaos with a hunger, each act bringing them closer to summoning the attention of the dark demon, whose favor could turn their conquest into an unstoppable crusade."
flavor_kryzzar.8.a: "Our offering will be enough!"

flavor_kryzzar.9.t: "Refugees From the Viakkoc Pack"
flavor_kryzzar.9.d: "A dozen ships, weathered and creaking, cut through the mist-shrouded waters and made landfall at the murky shores of the swamp. These vessels were manned by gnollish sailors from Viakkoc, fierce marauders of the sea who shunned the land for the thrill of waves and plunder. Hardened by salt and storm, they recounted grim tales of their fractured packs, scattered and broken by relentless assaults from neighboring human kingdoms."
flavor_kryzzar.9.a: "Their expertise will be invaluable!"

flavor_kryzzar.10.t: "City of Corpses"
flavor_kryzzar.10.d: "Nathalaire sat alone, a brooding figure against the backdrop of a rugged island along the shores of the Folly. It was a place teeming with outlaws and criminals, huddled together like cattle, now trapped by the encroaching gnollish horde. The whispers of fear among the doomed residents grew into a low, frantic hum as the gnolls stormed the beaches, eyes glinting with predatory intent.\n\nWith brutal efficiency, the gnollish warriors dismantled the island’s boats, splintering them apart to ensure no hope of escape remained. The timber was repurposed into towering pyres, their rough shapes casting long, ominous shadows in the fading light. The scent of sap and sea salt mingled with the metallic tang of dread.\n\nFor most of the island's population, these pyres would be their final destination, offerings in a grand display of fire and fervor. The rest were herded together, chains clinking as they were prepared for a life of servitude—fuel to drive the relentless might of the gnollish horde. The island fell silent, the air heavy with the anticipation of sacrifice and the weight of chains."
flavor_kryzzar.10.a: "The city will burn!"

flavor_kryzzar.11.t: "Fate of the Dwarves"
flavor_kryzzar.11.d: "Nestled within the embrace of jagged mountains, the hold of Ovdal Tungr held out for long against the gnollish siege. But against the relentless gnollish horde, driven by Kryzzar’s demonic fervor and ferocious might, even the famed dwarven defenses began to falter. Thunderous blows battered the gates and shattered stone, and the proud defenders found themselves overwhelmed by the snarling sea of invaders. After days of ceaseless assault, the dwarves, exhausted and bloodied, had no choice but to surrender as their hold was plundered of its treasures and pride.\n\nYet, the towering gnolls found the hold’s narrow halls and stout chambers stifling, ill-suited to their stature and battle-ready nature. In their cunning, a new idea was born: Ovdal Tungr would be repurposed as a soldier-slave state. The dwarves, bound by iron and stripped of their freedom, would be forced to wield their own formidable weaponry and siegecraft in service to their conquerors. Their skill would now be turned to breaching walls and fortifications under the command of their new masters."
flavor_kryzzar.11.a: "The dwarves will serve us well!"
flavor_kryzzar.11.b: "They will slave in the mines with the rest."

flavor_kryzzar.12.t: "Wyvern Eggs Found!"
flavor_kryzzar.12.d: "Deep within the craggy peaks of the mountains, the gnollish warlocks uncovered a hidden cache of wyvern eggs, their shells gleaming with a dark, iridescent sheen. The warlocks, their eyes alight with a feverish gleam, knew that these eggs held the potential to unleash"
flavor_kryzzar.12.a: "The wyverns will spew hellfire."

flavor_kryzzar.13.t: "The World on a Platter."
flavor_kryzzar.13.d: "With the burning of Anbenncóst, the message sent is clear, Cannor is at mercy of our horde. The once proud city of Anbenncóst, a symbol of the Empire's power and wealth, now lies in ruins, its streets awash with blood and ash. But the hunger of the flames are never sated and the rest of Cannor will soon feel the wrath of the Flamemarked horde."
flavor_kryzzar.13.a: "Glory to the Great Kryzzar Horde!"
