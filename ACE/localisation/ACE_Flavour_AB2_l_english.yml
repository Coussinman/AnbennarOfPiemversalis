flavor_jaherkost.1.t: "Jaher Port Independence"
flavor_jaherkost.1.d: "The large Sun Elven minority living in Port Jaher have been increasingly vocal about their dissatisfaction with the rulers of Busilar ever since the end of the Lilac Wars. The long wars have brought devastation to the city and the kingdom has done nothing to help the city recover. Now rich and influencial merchants have declared that the city will break off from Busilar and become the independant merchant republic of Jaherkel."
flavor_jaherkost.1.a: "Not happening!"
flavor_jaherkost.1.b: "Let them go! For now..."

flavor_jaherkost.2.t: "Religious Stance"
flavor_jaherkost.2.d: "Jaherkel has long been a city of diverse beliefs and cultures. The Sun Elven minority believe in the Sun Cult, the Moon elf inhabitants of the city prefer to revere their ancestors and the majority of the Human population believes in the Regent Court. Now that we are independant from Busilar and the Sun elf minority is in control of the city, we must decide what our official stance on religion will be."
flavor_jaherkost.2.a: "They will see the light!"
flavor_jaherkost.2.b: "Let them keep their faith, the Sun Cult is for Sun Elves."

flavor_jaherkost.3.t: "Jadd Missionaries"
flavor_jaherkost.3.d2: "News of our young but precocious Republic and the presence of Sun Cult adherents in Cannor has reached distant shores. Drawn by this beacon of shared faith, a number of Jadd missionaries have arrived aboard foreign trade ships from Bulwar. With scrolls in hand and sermons on their lips, they seek to enlighten our people with the teachings of their revered Prophet Jaddar. Though their customs may differ, their fervour burns with the same solar flame.\nTheir words on redemption, unity and purpose and the three core tenets of the Jadd faith are reaching bigger and bigger crowds every every day, and it is now up to the government to either embrace or reject this wave of change...\n\nBe the Light\nFight the War on Halann\nAll creatures can be the Light"
flavor_jaherkost.3.d1: "Dozens of ships have arrived in our ports, carrying weary refugees—both human and elven—who claim to have fled from the distant lands of Far Salahad. They speak of the fall of the Desert Legion of Jaddari, once their protectors, brought low by Zokka the Devourer of Suns, a dark force sweeping the region. Their journey took them across Bulwar and now to our shores.\n\nAmong them are Jadd missionaries, followers of a radical and heretical offshoot of the Sun Cult. While their beliefs stray far from our own, Jaherkel is a republic that has long embraced diversity of faith. These refugees seek safety, and our republic seeks growth."
flavor_jaherkost.3.a: "They can stay as long as they don't cause trouble."

flavor_jaherkost.13.t: "Jadd Preachers"
flavor_jaherkost.13.d: "Just as we feared, the Jadd preachers have not remained silent. In the streets of Port Jaher, they hold loud and passionate sermons, proclaiming that the Sun Elves are not the sole chosen of Surael. Instead, they teach that all races are chosen to carry the light and stand against the Malevolent Dark.\n\nTheir words are spreading quickly, drawing in curious and hopeful crowds. Many find comfort in their inclusive message, but the established religious leaders of our republic are growing increasingly uneasy. Tensions rise, and a conflict of faith may soon be at hand."
flavor_jaherkost.13.a: "Let's hope it will blow over."

flavor_jaherkost.14.t: "A Heretical Mayor"
flavor_jaherkost.14.d: "With the diversity of our city, it is no surprise that the teachings of the Jadd have found fertile ground. The idea that all are equal in the light of Surael has resonated deeply with the people, who see in it a reflection of their own lives and struggles.\n\nThe teachings have now reached [Root.Monarch.GetName], who—despite being a Sun Elf—has openly embraced the Jadd Faith. In a public proclamation, [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared that no race should be exalted above another by birth alone, and that unity in purpose is greater than blood. With this bold move, the republic stands at a crossroads of tradition and transformation."
flavor_jaherkost.14.a: "The Clergy is outraged!"

flavor_jaherkost.15.t: "The Jadd Proclamation"
flavor_jaherkost.15.d: "It’s only been a few short years since the Jadd missionaries first stepped off their boats, but in that time, the soul of our republic has transformed. Their message of unity, of light shared by all regardless of race or origin, has kindled a fire in the hearts of the people.\n\nWith the Mayor’s public conversion, the movement has surged with unstoppable momentum. Now, calls ring out in every district—citizens, elves and humans alike, demanding the official recognition of the Jadd as the republic’s primary faith. The fires of belief burn too bright to be extinguished. There is no returning to the old ways. A new chapter for our republic begins."

We came with an proposistion, we would help them revolt against Busilar and restore their duchy, and in return they would pay tribute to our Republic."
