A48_uncertain_succession_title: "Uncertain Succession"
A48_uncertain_succession_desc: "Left with only the bastard daughter Lisolette has potential direct heir, Ewald II has decided to legitimize her rather than let the duchy fall to his cousins or other claimants.\nThis decision has sparked outrage among many nobles who see her as illegitimate, either because of noble customs or because of political ties to other candidates.\n\nSecuring local support is naturally something Ewald II has strove to achieve, but marrying Lisolette to one of the established dynasties in the empire can also help her in gathering support against potential threats to her power when Ewald inevitably passes away.\nHe must ingratiate himself well with one of the major principalities of the empire to convince them to marry one of their members into the síl Rhinmond family to maintain the dynasty through these dire times."

A48_heritage_old_kingdom_title: "Heritage of the old Kingdoms"
A48_heritage_old_kingdom_desc: "Despite our claim to the throne as well as the continuation of the dynasty having been secured, we have yet to win over the nobles that failed to join either side in the succession war.\nWith the grand duchy to our north looking for an opportunity to reassert their feudal rights over us and our foreign enemies still seeking new pretenders to support, we must unify our nobility and people under a shared cause.\n\nUs Wexonards rallied together multiple times in our long history and achieved great feats, we must learn from our ancestors' mistakes and successes alike.\nLet us recount the marvelous history of the Wexonard people and its various kingdoms, because only by knowing what decisions lead us to be where we are can we determine our birthright and destiny."

A48_resplendent_capital_title: "Resplendent Capital"
A48_resplendent_capital_desc: "Rhinn the Progenitor founded the hilltop settlement of Rhinmond as a frontier fort-town in his war against the Milcori, but the town has since then grown into a prosperous center of trade and production.\nThe city has for a time declined in the aftermath of Nichmer's invasion and the landing of the Elves, with the towns along the Cotumer river as well as Escandar benefitting from the influx of Elves.\nAfter the reformation of the duchy of Sugamber under the Fourth Kingdom, the town has once again reestablished itself as the preeminent center of the Sugambrians.\n\nWith our de facto independence, we can invest a larger portion of our resources for the enlargement of the city and its embellishment, starting with the expansion of the silk cloth industry already present in the city as well as part-taking in the artistic and cultural movements stemming from the Lencori and West Damesheadic cities."

A48_sugambrian_funfairs_title: "Sugambrian Funfairs"
A48_sugambrian_funfairs_desc: "The funfairs in Lockcastle have organically grown through generations and become a yearly summer festival that attracts people all across the Wexonard lands as well as many Arannese people and travelers.\nThe dukes in Rhinmond and the upper nobles have eventually also started attending these popular festivals and endorsed them, fostering their growth even further and with the political and economic growth of our realm, the funfairs have begun to attract many visitors from different corners of Cannor.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] shall divest a large amount of funds to expand the infrastructure used for the funfairs and declare them a official Sugambrian festival.\nBy inviting important nobles from all across Cannor to regularly attend, the diplomatic standing of Sugamber will improve and the funfairs will be a thriving market for locally produced goods."

A48_amber_court_title: "Amber Court"
A48_amber_court_desc: "A long standing tradition in Sugamber has been the ample usage of elected commoners in the governance of our villages and towns.\nThe population elects their commoner peers to be further selected by our noble administrators to serve officially with the duke's patronage.\nThis system has resulted in the creation of a class of officials which answers both to their fellow commoners but also has to demonstrate loyalty toward the duke.\nDespite the success of this system, the outstanding individuals within this class have been unable to make full use of their talents, lacking paths for social mobility.\nWith the expansion of our realm beyond Sugambrian and Wexonard lands, our demand for loyal administrators has grown tremendously.\n\nThe famous amber court in Rhinmond shall be expanded to host and train advisors and governors stemming from this class of commoners that proved their worth and distinguished themselves."

A48_liberators_akasik_title: "Liberators of Akasik"
A48_liberators_akasik_desc: "Just as Sedoric and his father, we came to Akasik and successfully restored peace to a devastated land and won freedom for a population enslaved by gnolls.\nDespite Deshak's brief period as the sole Crodamic kingdom, it has remained the Akasi region with most Crodamic settlement and influence which slowly diffused throughout the population.\nDeshak has also long been influenced by constant trade and contact with the island of Tef.\nAdditionally, the Akasi faith has been scrutinized by Cannorian priests and shown to vaguely resemble the earliest phase of the cosmos as the Regent Court understands it, with Mother Akasik resembling the deceased Halanna.\n\nThrough these influences and possibly ancient ties to the Castanites and their faith, the Deshaki are relatively close culturally and by spreading this culture to the rest of Akasik and encouraging Wexonards to settle the depopulated Akasi lands, we will cement the ties between the populations across the Divenhali gates and win the loyalty of the Akasik lands."

A48_prosperous_akasik_title: "Prosperous Akasik"
A48_prosperous_akasik_desc: "After decades of recovery, the lands of Akasik once again brim with life and human settlement dot every valley and mountainside where previously only gnolls roamed.\nWhile the people of Akasik have been unified under one Crodamized culture loyal to us, the religious differences have proven a barrier to full integration of the region.\nWe will restore and expand temples dedicated to Mother Akasik and promote a doctrine that equates her to the goddess Halanna and also promote reverence of her by Cannorian settlers in Akasik.\n\nThrough our efforts, we will provide a bridge connecting the Akasik and Cannorian faiths, despite the key differences between the two.\nBy partially integrating the Mother Akasik faith, we will provide the planetouched in the region a place within our society as individuals blessed by Halanna."

A48_explore_labyrinths_title: "Explore the Labyrinths"
A48_explore_labyrinths_desc: "In the archives of Nirat we have uncovered documents that furthered our understanding of Milcori labyrinths.\nWhile far from complete or detailed maps, these have convince many of our adventurers to explore the labyrinth in Rhinmond as well as other key labyrinths in the Borders, with some even seeking to find Xamarzu or his phylactery.\n\nTo prevent the theft and smuggling of dangerous Milcori artifacts, the exploration must be well regulated and supported by the state, by employing the strongest paladins and beast hunters, countering the necromancy that will likely be employed in any traps in said labyrinths."

A48_slay_xamarzu_title: "Slay Xamarzu"
A48_slay_xamarzu_desc: "After exploring the other labyrinths, maps and accounts of the labyrinths found there have been cross referenced and we are now certain of the location of Xamarzu or possibly his phylactery within the labyrinth of Varlosen.\nAfter a millennium of hiding, he must certainly be ready to unleash hell on us and we must be fully ready to confront him in the dungeons and finally slay him and end the last remnant of old Milcorissia.\n\nWith support of the mages of the Magisterium and the knights of Aldresia, we will prepare a expeditionary force tasked with killing him, directly or not."

A48_end_long_war_title: "End of the Long War"
A48_end_long_war_desc: "More than a millennium after its start, the long war against Milcorissia and its last lich-king has finally ended.\nNo longer will the leeching necromancers prey upon the dead or threaten the upstanding inhabitants of the region.\nThe Borders have been transformed from a land with divided loyalties, a land of of populations with irreconcilable identities and worldviews to a land fully united under the glorious nation of Wex.\nThe ancient Neratic cult has been uncovered and its beautiful temple-labyrinths that the ancient pre-Milcori inhabitants built and maintained will be restored.\nThe long Milcori stain is now extirpated and exterminated from our land and every memory of it will soon be forgotten.\n\nAwaking from a three thousand year long nightmare, the Borders can truly prosper and reach new heights under us."

A48_wexonard_charge_title: "Wexonards in Charge"
A48_wexonard_charge_desc: "Ewald threw his lot with Lothane síl Wex during the 4th Lilac War and through two decades of heavy warfare helped to secure the victory for the Rose Party.\nAs payment for his efforts, Sugamber was granted independence from the grand duchy of Wex and the duchy expanded over East Bisan and West Celliande.\n\nThe Moon Party remains a thorn on the sides of the duchy, with Bisan and Celliande both eagerly awaiting the chance to get their land back from us.\nSugamber must take advantage of this period of Wexonard domination in imperial politics to thrive, our enemies must be vanquished and the time to do so is now."

A48_lions_west_title: "Lions to our West"
A48_lions_west_desc: "While we didn't join the Rose party alongside our liege out of purely idealistic reasons, we don't pretend otherwise in front of other princes.\nThe hyenas of Bisan fancy themselves both as loyal servants of the 'rightful' Damerian emperor as well as lions that right wrongs through pure and glorious violence, yet the reality is they spent two decades being the lackey of a self-interested dynasty that wouldn't have properly rewarded their loyalty and ultimately ended up losing half of their land to us.\nOn top of their pretensions, they have also pitted the Neratic clergy in Corseton against us, hosting even some Milcori-minded priests that seek to justify the crimes of Milcorissia and its lich kings.\n\nTheir arrogance will be curbed and their betrayal against their rightful emperor and liege as well as their betrayal toward Nerat will be punished.\nTheir land must be ruled by loyal Wexonards and their temples must be controlled by true followers of Nerat, meaning us of course."

A48_rightful_heirs_title: "Rightful Heirs of Wex"
A48_rightful_heirs_desc: "In our veins flows the blood of the Ryonard kings that unified a divided kingdom and defended it with their lives.\nLothane síl Wex has demonstrated great martial prowess and shattered the Damerian hold in imperial politics forever, but his plans to maintain Wexonard hegemony within Anbennar appear to be doomed to fail.\nThe nobles of the Wexhills have already doomed two of the kingdoms by fighting futile wars in the West Dameshead and by overextending their resources and then losing the fruits of their conquests as quickly as they gained them.\n\nWe must save Wex from its doom, the Sugambrians and the Ryonards shall lead Wex to glory!"

A48_return_ryonards_title: "Return of the Ryonards"
A48_return_ryonards_desc: "From the hills of Wexkeep to the foothills of the Khenak, from the necropolis of Corseton to our shining capital of Rhinmond, Wex is once again united under one ruler.\nAfter years of war, it is now time to heal our wounds and continue the unification of Wex not through violence or subterfuge, but through painstaking diplomacy.\nThe Wexhiller nobility will rally behind our cause and the Sugambrian vision will shape the future of the nation.\n\nWhen most of the nobility has finally accepted our rule, the Ryonard name and dynasty shall be restored during the coronation ceremony."

A48_king_in_wex_title: "King in Wex"
A48_king_in_wex_desc: "Despite reclaiming our position as heirs of the Ryonard dynasty, we remain merely grand dukes and are unable to claim the title of king our ancestors held.\nWith the formation of Anbennar, the kings of Dameria, Esmaria and Wex relinquished their title and restyled themselves as grand dukes, subject to the emperor.\nWhile restoring the kingdom will draw the ires of most Anbennarian princes and possibly result into a war, we might able to argue that our ruler could style [A48.Monarch.GetHerHim]self as 'king' while still ruling over the grand duchy of Wex, using our domain over the former and non-Anbennarian kingdom of Busilar as justification.\nFull support of the Wexhillers is paramount for our daring attempt to have a chance to succeed.\nAdditionally electors must be convinced to at least allow us petition the emperor for permission to use the title, if not outright support it."

A48_ceremonial_capital_title: "Ceremonial Capital"
A48_ceremonial_capital_desc: "Wexkeep served as the capital of most Wexonard kingdoms, with other cities only serving as temporary de facto capitals.\nAs opposed to the Wexhiller-lead kingdoms, we hold no interest in Esmaria or Dameria and instead look to dominate the lands of the Borders, Businor and Sarhal.\nThis leaves Rhinmond as the perfect capital, which has long been an important Wexonard city, founded by Rhinn 'the Progenitor' and capital during the glorious rule of Rhinn 'the Lichbane'.\nYet the historical and cultural importance of Wexkeep cannot be ignored, the settlements surrounding the main route between Wexkeep and Rhinmond must be expanded to be able to support continuous travel of Sugambrian and Wexhiller nobles and administrators.\n\nRhinmond will be the main administrative and economic capital of the entire realm.\nWexkeep will serve as the seat where Ryonard kings are crowned, where they manage internal Wexonard affairs and where Wexonard artifacts are stored, as well as being an impenetrable bastion defending our northern flank.\nAdditionally its cool climate will help our elder family members through the hottest weeks of summer."

A48_unravel_nirat_archives_title: "Unravel Nirat's Archives"
A48_unravel_nirat_archives_desc: "The archives of Nirat are what initially spurred our decision to invade Kheterata, yet we had to restrain our enthusiasm even as we finally seize the city.\nThe Khetist priests continue to defy us, threatening to burn the archive down if we forced their hand.\nBy establishing proper peacetime rule and placing a large garrison in the city, we can start to slowly convince the priests of our good intentions and offer them to collaborate with our clergy alongside Imperial and Delta Gnomish translators scribes and printers.\n\nWe will offer them to translate other ancient texts into the modern Kheteratan tongue and make them impervious to accidents by copying them using printing presses and storing copies in our Akasik and Cannorian libraries.\nThe Neratic priests have also offered to discuss matters of theology with the Khetist priests, having taken a keen interest in the story of Elikhet and questioning the nature of his being and his problematic ability to defy death."

A48_elikhet_court_title: "Elikhet and the Court"
A48_elikhet_court_desc: "With the translations of stories describing the ancient feats of Elikhet, the god has garnered the attention of many Cannorians in our realm, which has spurred the construction of the Great Pyramid of Elikhet, combining Neratic and Khetist motifs to appeal to both faiths.\nTo abate Cannorian distrust towards anything associated with defying death, the Neratic priests have popularized the doctrine that some gods might gain the ability to revive themselves with Nerat's support without any repercussion.\nElikhet the Resurgent is argued to having been granted a second life by Nerat to guard Sarhal and indirectly Cannor from the continuous threat of genies and demons.\n\nFar more controversial has been the theory that Castellos himself has gained this ability with his help.\nThis theory is pushed by Castellossian priests that seek to explain how Castellos could have died during the Day of Ashen Skies while still appearing as the Silver Dragon during the Dragonwake centuries afterwards.\n\nAs the debates rage on, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has the ability to steer the official faith and lead the realm as a united front in this age of religious uncertainty and conflict."

A48_hammer_faith_title: "Hammer of the Faith"
A48_hammer_faith_desc: "Having unified the realm under our Neratic-Khetist doctrine, it is time to look outward and confront the heretics in Anbennar.\nAlthough we might pursue a policy of disinterest toward the religious conflicts, the reality is that were the heretics to win gain supremacy in Anbennar they might stop our faithful from visiting other temples and might even seek our destruction when the opportunity comes.\n\nWe must act now and stop this scenario from occurring, we will show the heretics the truth of our ways, if not peacefully in temples then on violently on the battlefield."

#Column 3

A48_repair_shield_title: "Repair the Shield"
A48_repair_shield_desc: "Escandar, one of the three wonders of the elf Calasandur, has for centuries served its purpose of defending the northern side of the Khenak range.\nThe fortress has been neglected after fall of the duchy of Escandar when centers of power in the region shifted to Rhinmond, Bisan and Magdalaire.\nWith the gnollish threat subsiding, fewer funds have been directed to the fortress, which is now facing a relatively quiet border with Busilar.\nWith the unification of the Hillthrone Gnolls under Xanzerbexis alongside the subjugation of Akasik under Viakkoc, the gnollish threat to the empire is once again a pressing concern in the mind of many princes.\n\nWhile many are skeptical that the gnolls will ever be able to invade the empire, we can convince the Silcalas that the restoration of Escandar is of vital importance for the entire empire and thus guarantee their financial and technical support in the restoration efforts, although some of them seek land grants in the region as well as noble titles in exchange for their support."

A48_hammer_empire_title: "Hammer of the Empire"
A48_hammer_empire_desc: "With the restoration of Escandar completed, we have attracted imperial adventurers and mercenaries that seek adventure and war against the enemies of Cannor but are disinterested or wary to fight in Escann.\nOur efforts have also humbled the Busilari, which have for generations bore the burden of facing gnollish raids and have recently failed to prevent the rise of Xanzerbexis.\n\nWe can leverage our new found prestige to denounce the Busilari for their failures and incompetence and stake a claim, if teneuous, over their lands, in order to prevent further gnollish raids.\nThrough ownership of Escandar we are the southern shield of the empire, but we also must be its hammer and vanquish any potential threat. We must not wallow in complacency while leaving our enemies the opportunity to grow stronger."

A48_lions_south_title: "Lions to our South"
A48_lions_south_desc: "Thanks to the support of imperial mercenaries, we have pushed the borders of the empire beyond the Khenak and seized the hinterlands of Busilar, which are dominated by a mix of mining towns, sheep and cattle herders.\nDespite the seemingly peripheral and simple nature of the region, we recognize the strength of our southern neighbors that lived up to their lion symbolism by facing and fighting the Hillthrone Gnolls head on for almost two millennia since the gnolls first invaded the region.\n\nUnder our protection, the gnollish threat shall soon end and a new golden age for the hinterland of Busilar and the Borders alike will begin, yet the rest of Busilar still deludes itself in thinking they can defeat and push us back.\nWe will slay them to the last lion."

A48_lionsbane_title: "Lionsbane"
A48_lionsbane_desc: "Bisan, Busilar and Arannen, formerly independent states full of proud lions and yet all of them now reluctantly kneel when facing our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] representatives.\nThe Busilari, Bisanese and Milcori all hold an affinity for lions and their heraldic symbols displayed such magnificent beasts, it is only fitting for the dukes of Sugamber to adopt the title of 'Lionsbane' from now on, to commemorate our victory over our rivals after decades of warfare.\n\nDespite our victory, the conquered nobles remain restless and undermine our control of the region at every turn.\nTo truly unify the Borders and Busilar, we must crack down on tax evasion, brigandry and conspiracies against us."

A48_nature_nerat_title: "Nature of Nerat"
A48_nature_nerat_desc: "The Neratic priestly hierarchy has been brought under our control, with the Bisanese and Milcori-minded clergy replaced with ones loyal to us and temples in our lands placed under strict supervision.\nA garrison will be permanently stationed in Corseton to guard both the necropolis and the labyrinth underneath.\nSadly, the Long War against the Milcori can't be won through such forceful methods alone, we must also investigate and dismantle their lies and propaganda.\nFor this reason, the Neratic priests will convene to research and discuss the nature of Nerat."

A48_fallen_crodamics_title: "Fallen Crodamics"
A48_fallen_crodamics_desc: "The Crodamos, with which we share ancient blood ties, have intermittently ruled Kheterata and acted as Stewards of the Sorrow for a millennium, yet have recently suffered setbacks and lost hold of their southern lands after the gnolls of Grizaka conquer the valley of the upper Sorrow.\nWith the Ahati growing restless, the Nirakhetist uprising tearing the remaining Kheteratan people apart and continuous Eliznan interference, the future of Kheterata looks uncertain.\nA millennium ago, Sedoric, founder of the Crodamos dynasty, crossed the gates of the Divenhal and unified Akasik before being invited to restore order in Kheterata after Aakhet's death.\n\nPerhaps a new Sedoric must rise to the occasion and restore stability in northern Sarhal, and who is better fit than the heirs of the Morbani tribe, brothers to the Crodamic tribe of Sedoric?\nA proclamation will be sent to the Divenhali states that we will replicate the feats of the ancient Crodamics and restore order in Akasik and Kheterata by helping the Crodamos to restore control over the Sorrow."

A48_across_gates_title: "Across the Gates"
A48_across_gates_desc: "The Crodamics crossed the Divenhal with the support of the Tefori republic, which recently broke off the dying Damerian republic during the Dragonwake.\nEborthíl, on the contrary, was far more ambitious and held direct interest in Akasik, thus having no interest to help us in expanding in Sarhal.\nUnlike the migratory Crodamics, we were able to build a navy and had no need to rely on the Tefori, instead invading the island itself was part of our goal of securing the gates of the Divenhal and build a secure naval route between our Cannorian ports and Sarhal.\n\nWith Tef and a bridgehead in Sarhal secured, the liberation of Akasik and Kheterata will start in full force."

A48_invading_delta_title: "Invading the Delta"
A48_invading_delta_desc: "While Sedoric was lucky to be offered to rule over Kheterata, we have to secure control of the Sorrow by force and the Delta with its rich farmlands and shining cities are our first conquest.\nWith our many victories, our proclamation has started to be taken in consideration by Kheteratans, with many nobles seeing where the wind is blowing and opting to declare their loyalty towards us and a few of the Khets reportedly taking interest in us.\n\nSoon all of Kheterata will follow our lead and help in ushering a Crodamic renaissance."

A48_meeting_khetarch_title: "Meeting the Khetarch"
A48_meeting_khetarch_desc: "As most of Kheterata is now under our control, most Khets have finally noticed a disruption in their aloof lifestyle and have asked their Khetarch to arrange a new deal, seeking an immediate restoration of the previous arrangements that supported said lifestyle, ready to accept our rule as Steward of the Sorrow.\n\nAlongside the Khetarch, the elites of Kheterata such as upper nobles, the northern Ahati brotherhood and Elikhetist and Nirakhetist priests alike have being invited to discuss the future of Kheterata and the terms on which we will restore proper Crodamic rule.\nWe might be able secure the full support of powerbrokers in the region if we prove ourselves worthy to them."

A48_proper_stewards_title: "Proper Stewards"
A48_proper_stewards_desc: "With the Sorrow firmly under our control and flourishing and the Kheteratan factions dealt with, our position as steward is finally secure.\nKheterata has experienced many golden ages in its long history, yet it has also suffered ruin at the hand of weak and incompetent stewards that inherited their title without having the education and skills to fulfill the duties that such a role is burdened with.\n\nWith the help of the loyal Khetist priests, Kheteratan nobles and mages, most members of the Crodamos dynasty will be trained to fulfill the duty of stewards and be granted important positions in various Kheteratan cities and towns.\nThrough their training and positions, they will be able to support the steward and even swiftly replace him in his duties in case of premature or unexpected death.\nIf we wish to continue Crodamic Kheterata for eternity, the dynasty must prove itself worthy."

A48_last_stewards_title: "The Last Stewards"
A48_last_stewards_desc: "Finally, after decades of warfare all of the ancient enemies and rivals of Kheterata have been humbled and most of Sarhal now lies under our rule.\nThrough settlement programs and land grants to loyal populations, the southern Kheteratan lands now follow proper Hapremiti customs and are firmly loyal to us, ending any threat of rebellion or disloyalty.\nOur dynasty has ruled Kheterata for a millenium and despite the many challenges, we survived and with the support of our Wexonard and Morbani brothers restored the magnificent empire.\nWith the full support of the Khet and Kheteratan elites, we will issue a proclamation to all Kheteratans and Sarhal.\n\nThe Crodamos shall be the only Stewards of the Sorrow for eternity, for as long as the waters of the Sorrow flow a Crodamos will nurture and defend it and its valley.\nIf every Crodamos were to die, the position of Steward will die with them."

A48_expand_shoe_production_desc: "The lands of the Borders present a challenge to anyone deciding to journey through them.\nAlthough for most yet-to-be travellers the threat of gnollish raids is the biggest worry, they soon realize that the real challenge during the journey is the rugged landscape and how it is affected by the seasonal temperature swings.\nLuckily for them, Sugambrians are ready to impart knowledge on how to deal with such problems as well as sell them some expensive but durable boots.\n\nWith the end of the Lilac Wars and with more travelers heading toward the devastated Escann every day, we must expand our production of boots and sell abroad, taking advantage of our reputation in the shoemaking industry.\nThe princess Lisolette herself has taken a keen interest in the expansion of textile and shoe industry, trying to convince her father to divert ducal funds to these purposes now that the demand is high."

A48_bane_milcori_title: "Bane of the Milcori"
A48_bane_milcori_desc: "Since the very first day they descended from the Wexhills, our ancestors have faced the undead armies of Milcorissia and through decades of warfare they have won half of the Borders for our people, destroying the center of powers of the lich-king Xamarzu who has since then hid himself, awaiting the day he can emerge from his labyrinths and restore his wretched kingdom.\n\nWe must prevent that, starting with the destruction of Celliande, a duchy ruled and dominated by the portion of nobility that kept some of its Milcori identity through the centuries of warfare, destruction and settlement of other Cannorian peoples in the lands of Milcorissia.\nBut conquest is not enough, we must uproot this Milcori stain from the land and render it too powerless to carry out their plan to restore Milcorissia to the surface.\n\nThis phase of the Long War will also end with our victory."

A48_lions_east_title: "Lions to our East"
A48_lions_east_desc: "In the aftermath of the White Pestilence, the Roilsardi crusaders alongside other adventurers restored, or arguably introduced, civilization to the eastern Borders.\nOur stance toward our new neighbors has been cordial compared to the mutual hatred between us and the Milcori. The Arannese marquisate has adopted elements of Milcori culture, such as the symbol of the salt lion, but we have viewed them only as peer and friendly rivals, with them being the empire's eastern march and us its southern shield.\nSadly the 4th Lilac War has resulted in the break down of our relations, when Arannen fought alongside Celliande seeking our destruction, which would have been the first step toward the restoration of Milcorissia.\n\nWe cannot take any risk, Arannen must also be vanquished and centers of heterodox Neratic worship such as Varlosen must be closely monitored.\nWe are best fit to defend the eastern border of the empire from demonic gnolls, orcs and goblins alike."

A48_wexonard_cloth_industry_desc: "More than once have the land of the Eastern Borders suffered periods of destruction and destitution, which has stiffened the growth of cities and of local artisan and artistic traditions.\nDespite the challenges the geographical location presents an opportunity, facing the Eastern Divenhal directly the coastal towns can import foreign cotton, silk, wool and exotic animal pelts from Kheterata and Bulwar and produce unique clothes to sell in Cannorian markets, including our yearly Lockcastle Fair.\n\nThrough diplomacy and a large mercantile presence in Sarhal we will secure a steady supply of primary materials for our growing textile industries.\nUnder steady and stable Wexonard rule the Eastern borders will soon be as prosperous as the lands around the upper Cotumer."

A48_dominate_gnolls_title: "Dominate the Gnolls"
A48_dominate_gnolls_desc: "Gnolls have always been the enemy of all civilized races, they have entered the continent as demonic worshippers hunting the Castanites and have survived the righteous Cleansing of Castan Beastbane hiding in the Khenak.\nOver the two millennia Hill Gnolls have constantly raided the people living around the mountains, but over the millennia they have slowly abandoned some of their most gruesome practices, first opting to abandon human sacrifices and recently also seeking to earn wealth by fighting as mercenaries in Cannorian wars.\nIn the Folly however the Flamemarked Gnolls have remained as vicious and ferocious as they were during the Third Xhaz from which they originated, if not more.\n\nRegardless of their outward stance, the existence of independent gnollish pack in Cannor threatens all civilized peoples, they must be destroyed and their lands settled with humans.\nThose willing to abandon their demon worshiping ways can continue earning coin as mercenaries, as it's in our best interest if their violent and bloodthirsty nature is channeled toward fulfilling our goals."

A48_jailers_nerat_title: "Jailers of Nerat"
A48_jailers_nerat_desc: "With the destruction of Viakkoc ending any hope of gnollish rule in Cannor, more gnolls have openly or tacitly abandoned their demonic beliefs and have instead shown interest in their overlords' religion.\nWhile some have associated with Corin because of her domain over war, others have associated with Nerat, the dominant god in the Borders.\nSome daring gnolls have tried to justify cannibalism in war on the grounds that it weakens necromancers, which has consternated many Sugambrian authorities which were unsure whether to deal with such cases as examples of continued demonic worship or as heterodox Neratic beliefs.\nEventually the Neratic clergy has been tasked to proselytize the proper understanding of Nerat and stamp out heresy in the new gnollish converts.\nThe figure of Nerat, a god which has sided with the losing forces of evil, has fascinated the gnolls that see parallels between the role of Nerat within the Court and the position of gnolls in Sugamber.\n\nThe most fervent believers depict themselves as 'Hounds of Nerat', simultaneously redeeming their race and patron god by fighting necromancers and other demonic beings.\nWhile this doctrine is also heterodox, accepting it will help us harness their ferocity, even if other Cannorians will deride us for our 'tolerant' stance.\nAll gnolls shall fight in our armies or act as agents for our clergy to redeem their race of their uncountable crimes."

A48_unite_dynasties_desc: "During the conquest of Kheterata, our claim of being restorers of Crodamic rule has helped us finding allies among the nobility of Crodamic descent, especially the upper nobles that belong to or trace ancestry from the Crodamos dynasty.\nWhile their support was welcomed, merely promoting and integrating them in our administration would be foolish, as they might decide to unite and overthrow 'barbarian rule'.\nInstead we should seek to truly unite with our Crodamic kin by tying the Ryonard and Crodamos dynasties, so that our interests are theirs and vice versa.\n\nThrough marriages, bilateral fostering of young nobles, political adoptions and exchange of lands and titles we will unite the dynasties, so that every Ryonard will be regarded as a Crodamos in Sarhal and every Crodamos in Cannor will be regarded as a Ryonard.\nThrough this union we will also inherit the Crodamos' birthright, which means all the lands of the last Kheteratan empire rightfully belong to us and our armies shall prove it."

A48_coldblood_stable_title: "Coldblood Stable"
A48_coldblood_stable_desc: "With the creation of the royal stable, interest in new horse breeds has grown among our nobles. While they focus on finding horses able to travel the fastest across the plains of Sugamber or able to be hold the steadiest charge while saddled by heavily armored knights, some farmers have petitioned the crown to import horse breeds from lands such as Ording and even the cold lands of Gerudia.\nThese breeds are neither fast nor big, instead they possess a very calm demeanor, high stamina and a stocky body structure fit for long streaks of strenuous labor, perfect for helping with farmwork.\n\nThe Arannese people of Gisden have Wexonard ancestry and we can help them in growing closer to us by placing a secondary stable in the province of Quintenbury, where many of the coldblooded breeds from abroad will be placed to ensure a domestic supply of such workhorses.\nDespite their Wexonard ancestry stemming largely from the Wexhills or Bardswoods, the people of Gisden might slowly also develop a knack for horses like us Sugambrians, if not for jousting or horse riding then for their raw throughput in the fields."

A48_hotblood_stable_desc: "The success of our horse import schemes has spurred more daring plans, the officials have asked the crown to import horse breeds from Kheterata and Bulwar, breeds which possess a good combination of speed and stamina, making them perfect for relaying message across long distances as well as travel through arid terrains they are adapted to.\nWhile we can use our Rohibonic ties to import Kheteratan horses, our diplomatic ties to Bulwar are non-existent, with the Sun Elves guarding their breeds jealously.\n\nThrough diplomacy, bribery and subterfuge we might able to acquire enough hotblooded horses to establish a new stable, which would be placed in southern Busilar, the closest Cannorian region in terms of climate and vegetation to the drylands of Avamezan or the middle Sorrow.\nAlongside its usage in the administration of our realm the stable at Carverhouse can also serve as our southernmost continental military training center, where Sugambrian horseriders can slowly get acclimatized to hotter and drier climates while riding the same horses with whom they will travel, and conquer, the Salahad."

A48_mixed_horse_cavalry_desc: "A local supply of many horse breeds ought to have satisfied all horse fanatics in our lands, yet we were proven wrong.\nThe army has appreciated the usefulness of various breeds, but some officers argue that we should seek to combine, through interbreeding, specific traits found in breeds of completely different character and body shape.\nOne single generation of intermixing won't produce the desired result, decades of efforts must be spent to create breeds of warmblooded horses that are best able to assist in specific tasks, both in the army or in the economy.\nAn inspiration for this project is the so called 'Universal Horse' of Cestirande, a type of breed that seeks to fit many horseshoes at once, which has sparked criticism by horse experts in our court who argue that the breed is a jack of all trades and a master of none because of unavoidable trade offs in body composition, if not temperament.\n\nThus we won't chase the idea of a perfect breed, but instead seek to create very specialized breeds.\nAdditionally we will try to secure a small batch of the almost dead Adenican horses which have demonstrated a combination of traits rarely seen, which might prove vital for our experiments."

flavor_sugamber.1.d2: "Having infiltrated the ducal guard the conspirators were able to penetrate deep into the palace. They managed to bribe $MONARCH$'s cup bearer and taster and took [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] out with poisoned wine. Whilst Ethelbert's supporters were quick to acclaim him the rightful ruler, there are already rumours being spread by people who noticed the suspiciousness of the whole thing."
flavor_sugamber.1.d3: "Having infiltrated the ducal guard the plotters assumed that their victory was certain, but they didn't count on wine loosening one of their tongues. In a drunken stupor one of them accidentally hinted to their plans, and the innkeeper revealed this to $MONARCH$ in the hope of a reward. The defective guards were arrested in their beds, with one of them betraying everyone in the conspiracy in exchange for clemency. The remaining conspirators were then lured into the palace in the delusion that everything was going according to plan. Not a single one escaped."
flavor_sugamber.1.d4: "In the last moment, the conspirator responsible for contacting the captain of the guards got cold feet and delayed meeting him, unwittingly delaying his end. But it wasn't enough to save the conspirators — another one of them got cold feet and betrayed the plot in order to save himself. All the other traitors were caught in the night, with most ending up dead."
flavor_sugamber.1.d5: "After receiving word of the conspiracy $MONARCH$, immediately sent the ducal guard to root out the traitorous nobles hiding in Rhinmond. Now they prepare their siege equipment to go after any accomplices who managed to escape towards their castles. This moment, however, does give the survivors of the plot an opportunity to take the initiative."
flavor_sugamber.1.d6: "After receiving word of the conspiracy, $MONARCH$ immediately sent the ducal guard to root out the traitorous nobles hiding in Rhinmond. However this left the palace weakly defended which allowed a small group of the conspirators to sneak in and kill $MONARCH$ and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. At the same time the ducal guard spread itself thin which allowed the rebels to pick them off in groups and take over the capital."

In the post Jexisian period the final kingdom will see its end, not through war but through the scheming of mages that sought to end the wars in the region, the kingdoms would become grand duchies under an united empire.\nYet the empire was rarely at peace as the Wars of Rule and then the Lilac wars took countless lives and shattered the grand duchy of Dameria and Esmaria.\nWith the end of the 4th Lilac War, Wex is the last grand duchy standing and yet it's more divided than ever, as we secured our independence in exchange for full support to Rose party.\nThe plans of Lothane might be as foolish as they are ambitious, for trying to coopt the imperial institutions by force could easily lead to backlash and the partition and end of Wex after his inevitable death.\nIt was the Sugambrian kings that resisted Korbarid, Milcori and Bahari incursions and saved Wex during its vulnerable early period and it must be Sugambrian dukes that lead Wex through these turbulent times and keep in check the ambitions and foolishness of the Wexonards of the hills, lest we lose what our ancestors fought for."

Even if a god did so that would hint at the use of dark arts, yet Elikhet was always at the forefront of the fight against the dark forces of Sarhal, always dedicated to the prosperity of his race and his people.\nEven if he defied death he did so to help his kingdom free themselves from Damerian rule and survive the troubled times.\nCould it be that there is a legitimate usage of necromancy?\nThe priests reject this notion more vehemently than ever after confidently knowing Nerat has never been proven to endorse this magic.\nInstead they opted to argue that if anyone could rightfully defy death it could only be with Nerat's help and only with a proper justification.\nIf Elikhet defied death and he is indeed not corrupted, then he must have Nerat's support.\n\nThese debates have also caught the attention of disgruntled and depressed Castellossian priests that held belief in the survival of Castellos, while the murals have proven that he died in the Day of Ashen Skies, why wouldn't he also be granted the power to transcend death just as Elikhet did?\nIndeed they have argued that Castellos appeared in the Dragonwake and just as Elikhet did he helped his people when they most needed him.\n\n'CASTELLOS IS DEAD', people cry.\nBut does he stay dead?"

flavor_sugamber.160.a: "We will finally find the end!"

flavor_sugamber.161.t: "Troubles in Varlosen"
flavor_sugamber.161.desc: "The labyrinth of Varlosen kept proving itself the hardest to navigate, with continuous traps and attacks of undead hordes pushing our adventurers back and diverting the attention of less brave adventurers to other, less threatening, prospects.\nThe amount of resistance alongside the former presence of the Lodge of Nameless in the region has naturally lead many among us to assume that Xamarzu must indeed be hiding there.\nAdding to that suspicion is the fact that labyrinth of Varlosen is the only one of the four major ones that lays outside historical Wexonard land that Xamarzu first lost to us.\nRegardless of any theory, we must further support the efforts to push through the endless hordes."
flavor_sugamber.161.a: "Slowly, the adventurers will break through"

flavor_sugamber.162.t: "Ancient Neratic Murals"
flavor_sugamber.162.desc: "Finally the last remaining traps have been destroyed and the final hidden layer of Corseton's labyrinth have been found.\nImmediately our adventurers realized the ancient nature of these labyrinths, stemming from a time before necromancy enslaved the region, with beautiful murals of unknown gods dotting most walls.\nWhile lacking in writing, the murals depict ancient stories involving the gods, with a figure possibly resembling Nerat protecting the miners against strange threats.\nFinding these murals is only the start, decades of theological research will help truly understand the meaning hidden behind them."
flavor_sugamber.162.a: "The truth is slowly being unraveled"

flavor_sugamber.163.t: "First Milcori necromancers"
flavor_sugamber.163.desc: "In Wexkeep there was sadly little evidence of the true Neratic cult that preceded the Milcori, instead the deepest layers have instead been filled with murals showing contact with Infernal worshippers of Hedine just north of the Wexhills.\nThis fact has lead some to think the Milcori must have originated as a offshoot of the Esmari infernal worshippers that made themselves king of the previous inhabitants of the Borders, using their infernal support and eventually corrupting the local cults to fit their goals.\nJust as the liberation of the Borders started from the Wexhills, so did its corruption."
flavor_sugamber.163.a: "The dark age of the Borders began in this labyrinth"

flavor_sugamber.164.t: "Greed of the Lich-Kings"
flavor_sugamber.164.desc: "Finally having unraveled the mystery of the shifting labyrinth and with the help of small amounts of Black Damestear, or 'Korashi' as it's known in Haless, we have broke through the shifting layer of the labyrinth and entered the deeper layers.\nTo our relief, the creator of the labyrinth must have felt very confident in his abilities to stop intruders at the shifting labyrinth and our assumptions were proven right when we realized this labyrinth was constructed to house the treasures and slaves of Cernarex, an ancient Milcori lich-king.\nAccording to his own murals, Cernarex has been one of the vital figures that centralized Milcori society and its religion around and to the benefit of its lich-kings.\nIn his own hubris he must have decided to use the labyrinth to make a monument of himself while also taking care to make said labyrinth inaccessible to virtually anyone outside his lackeys and slaves, something that has perplexed the historians that have been brought to the location.\nRather than a monument that showcases the greatness of Milcori lich-kings, to us it's a clear sign of wasteful use of wealth by monsters that regarded their own subjects as mere slaves.\nWe shall record our findings and then loot this place of all of its treasures and then destroy the murals."
flavor_sugamber.164.a: "The Milcori became slave to their necromancy"

flavor_sugamber.165.t: "Progress in Varlosen"
flavor_sugamber.165.desc: "In Cernarex's labyrinth we have also uncovered partial maps of Varlosen labyrinth.\nNow that the other labyrinths have been conquered, our full focus has been concentrated on Varlosen.\nWith the help of Khet magic we have flooded many of the labyrinths and preventively killed and dismantle many of the traps laid down there.\nAfter months of underground warfare we have finally found the last layers of the labyrinth where Xamarzu must be hidden.\nWe must be fully prepared before confronting him."
flavor_sugamber.165.a: "The path to Xamarzu is clear"

flavor_sugamber.166.t: "The last stand of Milcorissia"
flavor_sugamber.166.desc: "Our attempt to slay Xamarzu started on the right foot, with our adventurers seemingly successfully approaching his phylactery.\nYet he has once again evaded us, having moved his phylactery to another location within the dungeon, probably one dug in the last millennium since his cowardly flight.\nThe amount of undead attacks in the labyrinths has also grown tremendously and our parties were forced to once again pull back.\n\nAs we were preparing to launch another and larger expedition to the dungeons, he must have realized the situation has grown too desperate to keep hiding and he did the unthinkable.\nUsing his full force of necromancers he has launched large scale attacks on the surface, seizing large portion of the eastern Borders, with millions of Wexonards fleeing the overrun areas.\nOur armies have been rapidly assembled to fight the last of the Milcori.\n\nWith this war the last of Milcori will be completely exterminated."
flavor_sugamber.166.a: "The Long War will soon end"

flavor_sugamber.167.t: "Liberation of Milcorissia"
flavor_sugamber.167.desc: "The Wexonard invaders have long occupied the lands, with the Sugambrians always on the lookout for our attempts to restore our rule on the surface.\nNow that they forced Xamarzu's hand we must show ourself to the world and proclaim the rebirth of Milcorissia and finally free the Borders."
flavor_sugamber.167.a: "Milcorissia will stand proud!"

flavor_sugamber.168.t: "The death of Xamarzu"
flavor_sugamber.168.desc: "After years of warfare and hundred of thousand of undead freed from their magical prison, we have finally ended Xamarzu's last stand.\nHaving found him hiding alongside his spent phylactery, once again attempting to hide like a coward as his supporters were slaughtered, our adventurers have finally managed to slay him.\nContrary to Nichmer, the last fight against Xamarzu has been very pathetic and unworthy of any epic plays.\nLacking the resources to mount a proper attack, he had to resort to drain most of his mana and life force to mount his desperate attack and with its failure only a shadow of his former power remained.\nThorburn, a daring young adventurer seeking to emulate the heroic Rhin 'the Lichbane', foolishly rushed to attack after his location was found.\nWhile everyone present feared the worst, Xamarzu was unable to even repel the clumsy attack of a novice and was struck down by the young man's dull blade.\n\nThus ended Milcorissia.\n\nAfter a reprimand from his father and party leader, Thorburn has been granted accolades and title of 'Bane of the Milcori', meant to be less a praise of the young man but rather a mockery directed at the fallen Milcori.\n\nNow that the land has been freed of the demonic threat, it is time to help the Wexonards resettle and rebuild their homes and fields devastated by the war."
flavor_sugamber.168.a: "In the Borders Nerat's empire stands and the gates of Hell shall never prevail against it"

flavor_sugamber.169.t: "Dark Ages"
flavor_sugamber.169.desc: "The unthinkable happened, what was meant to be an attack of desperation has succeeded in overrunning the Borders and Busilar, with our forces retreating to Sarhal to continue the Long War.\nYet the situation looks dire, as millions of Wexonard lay under Milcori oppression and the necromancers will be more than willing to kill all of them to fuel their armies."

flavor_sugamber.201.desc: "Many centuries ago, the forces of Arameh ravaged the lowlands of Wex, killing countless people and sacking countless cities.\nNow the descendants of the invaders will suffer the same fate. Their city will be burned, their harbors destroyed and the artifacts they stole from us will be retaken with interests."
flavor_sugamber.201.a: "Rhinn III has been avenged"

flavor_sugamber.202.t: "The restoration of Tulipsfield"
flavor_sugamber.202.desc: "The area now known as Butchersfield wasn't always called like this, before Elrac treacherously massacred our people it was known as the Tulipsfield, but even this name hints at a tragic event.\nArameh the invader has also butchered his way through Wex centuries prior, burning down the farms and villages of the area. In the aftermath of his retreat the surviving Wexonards slowly restored the land, though the flowery fields of the region were now more dominated by Bulwari tulips left behind by the invaders which the locals have taken a liking to. The region has previously bore a name of Milcori origin which the locals have no attachment to.\n With the wealth and prosperity of the area at an all time high the locals have decided to build a monument to their fallen ancestors and to also abandon the gruesome name that was given to this place and rename it Tulipsfield, asking the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to help with popularizing the older name and attend a solemn commemoration of the massacre."
