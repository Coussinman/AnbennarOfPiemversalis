 AD5_forgotten_feudalism_title:0 "Armringrskipan"
 AD5_forgotten_feudalism_desc:0 "Having left Cannor in 904 AA the Hallfreders missed the invention of the Cannorian feudal system. Armringrskipan, meaning 'Armring System' in the common tongue, refers to the Hallfreder variant of feudalism, which they have invented in relative isolation. It operates as a more complex and formal continuation of the ancient gerudian tradition of using armrings to denote agreements, oaths and subject-overlord relations. If the Hallfreder administration is to flourish, it will have to continue to nourish this system."

 AD5_recover_from_ofarar_title:0 "Recover from the Ófárár"
 AD5_recover_from_ofarar_desc:0 "Ófárár, meaning 'Disaster Year' in the common tongue, describes the year of 1443 AA, a particularly harsh winter, combined with a failed harvest, disappointing fishing yields, and a decade of deteriorating farming conditions due to rebellious Skraeling, mediocre seeds and a lack of farming equipment. It is up to the government to keep course through these troublesome years, where starvation is rampant."

 AD5_diversify_food_production_title:0 "The Road to Recovery"
 AD5_diversify_food_production_desc:0 "The arid lands of Brendrótaland leave little room for bountiful harvests, and yet, the people of Hallfredhavn must be fed. To survive and thrive, we must grow our food sources by cultivating grain where possible, expanding our fisheries, and ensuring a steady supply of livestock. Only by managing our industries with a care that befits a mother may we secure enough sustenance for all, ensuring the continuation and stability of our troubled realm and walking the long road to recovery."

 AD5_awaken_government_title:0 "Awaken Government"
 AD5_awaken_government_desc:0 "With Hallfredhavn’s Thing weakened and full of division, efforts must be made to restore governmental power. The institutions of governance must be revived, laws enforced, and leadership reestablished to secure stability and control once more. Only then can we hope to stop the hunger, end the Sidrvetr and look outwardly once again. We are in a state of deep slumber, almost as deep as the slumber of Elkaesel the White. It will take a lot to wake up."

 AD5_desperate_expansionist_policies_title:0 "Landsnámsverk Edicts"
 AD5_desperate_expansionist_policies_desc:0 "The lands beyond our borders hold the resources needed to save Hallfredhavn’s people. Settlers must be sent to claim new territories, seeking fertile pastures for livestock, rich veins of metal ore, and ample wool to end our shortages. Only through rapid colonisation and a collective effort can we secure the foundations of our prosperity."

 AD5_revive_metallurgy_title:0 "Revive Metallurgy"
 AD5_revive_metallurgy_desc:0 "The forge-fires of Hallfredhavn have cooled, for there is simply no ore. The elites hoard the last bits of metal while the peasants plow fields with wooden tools. To reclaim our strength, we must relight the forges, train new smiths, and secure a steady supply  of ore from the hills. Only then can we once again craft the weapons, tools, and armour that our people so desperately need."

 AD5_end_the_sidrvetr_title:0 "End the Sidrvetr"
 AD5_end_the_sidrvetr_desc:0 "The Sidrvetr, or Long Winter, has lasted long enough. Food should be plentiful and ships should sail from Hallfredhavn. An age of prosperity rests at our fingertips!"

 AD5_secure_lumber_and_wool_title:0 "A Realm Without Wool"
 AD5_secure_lumber_and_wool_desc:0 "The sheep and goats brought on the Expedition fleet are all gone. Whether it was disease, wild animals the butcher's knife that ook them, they are gone. We will need new sources of wool, so that we can once more fashion wool clothes and most importantly, sails."

 AD5_rebuild_the_navy_title:0 "Skipasmídaverk"
 AD5_rebuild_the_navy_desc:0 "Hallfredhavn’s natural harbour offers the perfect foundation for a grand shipyard, but our shipbuilding traditions have faded through the ages. By reviving the old techniques, training skilled shipwrights, and securing the finest burnroot, we will restore our mastery of the seas. With a renewed fleet birthed from a great shipyard, Hallfredhavn will once again command the waves and expand its reach across distant shores."

 AD5_taychendi_goods_title:0 "Skeggland Trade"
 AD5_taychendi_goods_desc:0 "Sporadic trade between Hallfredhavn and the Skegglands has existed for centuries, but with the wool shortage and the subsequent lack of seaworthy ships this trade has become entirely dependent on the Stadfastr, and thus the Skalir. If we are to build more sustainable trade system, we will have to invest in a navy and establish more proper contact."

 AD5_restore_gudafridr_title:0 "Religious Crossroads"
 AD5_restore_gudafridr_desc:0 "The Gudafridr Proclamation of 1100 AA, a cornerstone of the uneasy peace between the Skaldhyrrics and Cannorians, stands as a testament to the fragile balance that has long governed their coexistence. Though time and ambition have seen its terms trampled and its authority challenged, past rulers have managed to mend such transgressions through fines, restitution, and due process. Yet, in this time of turmoil, when grievances fester and tempers flare, the mechanisms of justice falter. If we are to salvage what remains of this accord, we must reinforce the institutions that uphold faith and law, reestablish order where chaos now reigns, and restore confidence in the document’s decrees.\nOr if we seek to forge a different path, we can leverage our influence in the clergy to do away with the Proclamation entirely..."

 AD5_fate_of_the_oonoi_title:0 "Fate of the Oonoi"
 AD5_fate_of_the_oonoi_desc:0 "The Oono'i are a people of great resilience, but their future hangs in the balance. The native Langeyru who once burned the living roots of the accursed Kykrskógr are now reduced to small bands of hunters. The Vidarfótar have enslaved many of them and demand the right to keep doing so, seeing them as tools to fuel their power, while the Pearlsguards desire their freedom, believing their true potential lies in alliance, not bondage. Bind them in servitude or forge a new path together... How we decide will shape not only their fate, but the future of Hallfredhavn itself."

 AD5_raid_the_skegglands_title:0 "Carve It Into your Spoils"
 AD5_raid_the_skegglands_desc:0 "The Reaverblood stirs within us, an unyielding call to conquest and adventure that echoes through the ages, urging us to seek plunder as our forebears once did. To the west lie the Skegglands, the rugged domain of the bearded Langeyru, a land teeming with wealth, provisions, and women—ripe for the taking. With the fire of battle burning in our veins and the salty winds filling our newly woven sails, we shall set forth upon the waves, guided by the promise of glory and spoils. The Skegglands shall tremble at the sight of our sails, figureheads and banners, their riches seized, their people subdued, as we carve our legacy into the annals of history with axe and flame."

 AD5_build_the_fleet_title:0 "Carve It Into the Sea"
 AD5_build_the_fleet_desc:0 "When the Voyage began, our ancestors set sail with five proud ships, each a testament to their ambition, resilience and wanderlust. Yet, as the centuries passed, the relentless trials of time, decay, and scarcity took their toll. One by one, our vessels were decommissioned, until only the Stadfastr remained. A lone survivor of a bygone era. But now, at long last, the tides have shifted in our favour. With the resources at hand and the infrastructure to support our ambitions, we stand poised to forge a fleet worthy of our name. For trade, for conquest, for plunder, our ships shall once again rule the waves, carrying forth the wanderlust of our ancestors as we carve our rightful domain out of Jotunnheim, the realm of giants."

 AD5_skeggland_outpost_title:0 "Skeggland Outpost"
 AD5_skeggland_outpost_desc:0 "To truly dominate the Skegglands, we must establish a foothold within their borders. A well-positioned outpost in Taychend will allow us to assert control over the region, facilitating raids along their southern coasts and staking our claim to the lands they hold dear. From here, we can gather resources, build our influence, and strike with precision, ensuring the Langeyru feel the weight of Hallfredhavn’s might. The time to establish our presence is now."

 AD5_brendrotaland_domination_title:0 "Brendrótaland Domination"
 AD5_brendrotaland_domination_desc:0 "The arid expanse of Brendrótaland, with its burned roots and harsh terrain, must be tamed and claimed. To secure our future, we must colonise its vast stretches, laying our roots deep in this unforgiving land. As we settle its shores, we will rename the territories in the Gerudian and common tongues, marking them as Hallfredhavn’s own. Only through relentless expansion and unceasing settling can we turn this desolate land into a true homeland for our people."

 AD5_hallfredrik_title:0 "Hallfredrík"
 AD5_hallfredrik_desc:0 "Once, we were but a city-state, clinging to the banks of the Árvár, but no longer. Our reach has expanded, our power has grown, and the time has come to shed the name of a mere haven. No longer shall we call ourselves Hallfredhavn—we are now Hallfredrík, a true realm with the strength to look beyond our borders. With our foundations secured, we turn our gaze outward, ready to shape the world as we see fit."

 AD5_forge_regalia_title:0 "Forge Regalia"
 AD5_forge_regalia_desc:0 "§YThis mission will be replaced with a Republic version, should we ever turn into one§!\n\nA Jarl is more than their deeds—they are also their predecessors. The regalia left by our predecessors is underwhelming... Some ancient armor and weaponry from the distant land of Cannor hardly seems fit for a Jarl... To forge a regalia worthy of a Reaver Jarl, we must find, conquer or plunder the finest materials from all of Jötunnheim: gold from distant shores, gemstones from deep within the earth, and the rarest fabrics woven with the skill of foreign artisans. With these, we shall craft a crown, a mantle, and an axe that speak of our might, a symbol of rule that none may question. Let all who see it know that the Jarls are not only true monarchs, but also affluent and resourceful."

 AD5_build_the_thingholl_title:0 "Build the Thingholl"
 AD5_build_the_thingholl_desc:0 "§YThis mission will be replaced with a Monarchy version, should we ever turn into one§!\n\nA Thing cannot govern from a ramshackle gathering place, and the Jotunnholl is woefully inadequate. A centuries old overturned longship propped up on poles, with a few wooden rooms haphazardly built around it—this is no proper seat of assembly, but a relic of necessity. If our republic is to mature, if our laws are to be upheld with the weight they deserve, we must construct a hall worthy of the Thing. A grand, purpose-built hall, where debates can echo with authority and decisions can be made with the dignity of true governance."

 AD5_develop_hallfredhavn_title:0 "Develop Hallfredhavn"
 AD5_develop_hallfredhavn_desc:0 "Our capital must stand as a beacon of civilisation and prosperity, but the arid land surrounding it threatens our growth. To guarantee future harvest, we must develop its infrastructure, expanding farmland and constructing vital irrigation canals along the Árvár River to combat the relentless dryness in this land that never rains. We shall transform this harsh land into a fertile heartland, ensuring harvests for generations to come."

 AD5_mature_economy_title:0 "Mature Economy"
 AD5_mature_economy_desc:0 "The men and women of Hallfredhavn tend to be largely self sufficient, trading for but a few goods to fill their larders and replace what breaks. Some subcultures use currencies, but there exists no official coin. The Oono'i use rare shells, the Skalir and Vidarfótr use coins from the Skegglands, whilst other groups have traded bits of metal for centuries. An official currency and healthy industries are necessary to birth a mature economy... One with copper coins, and maybe even silver or gold ones..."

 AD5_sail_to_distant_shores_title:0 "Sail to Distant Shores"
 AD5_sail_to_distant_shores_desc:0 "The fishermen, whalers and pearldivers of [ROOT.GetUsableName] are hungry for more seas to ply their trades. We should give them distant ports and shores, so they may fill their holds, and in turn, our markets."

 AD5_giant_gate_title:0 "Giant Gate"
 AD5_giant_gate_desc:0 "The Jötunnsstraumr is the source of all prosperity in Jötunndalr, it is a river that is as big as the giants that once dwelled here. To control it is to hold the key to the north, for its currents lead ever onward to the City of the World’s Desire—Jötunnborg. Yet before we can claim the river as our own, we must seize its gateway: Steinjötunn, the island that guards its estuary. Small in size but teeming with people, Steinjötunn is a prize of immense strategic value. Here stands the Stone Giant, an enigmatic colossus—some call it a mere statue, while others whisper that it is a true Jötunn, turned to stone by fate or divine will. Whatever the truth, the island must be brought under our rule. Only then can the Jötunnsstraumr flow freely into our hands, and only then can our path to Jötunnborg truly begin."

 AD5_at_the_gates_of_jotunnborg_title:0 "At the Gates of Jötunnborg"
 AD5_at_the_gates_of_jotunnborg_desc:0 "The Jötunnsstraumr has been wrested from foreign hands, its estuary secured, its waters ours to command. Yet a river is more than its mouth—its true power lies in the endless flow of ships, supplies, and men it can carry. If we are to seize Jötunnborg, the City of the World’s Desire, we must do more than merely stand at its threshold—we must control the very veins that lead to its heart. Every bend of the Jötunnsstraumr must lie open to us, every ford and crossing held firm beneath our banner or those of our allies. Only then can our armies march unimpeded and well fed, and our warships bring death and dominion to the very walls of Jötunnborg. To leave the river in the hands of others is to strangle our own conquest before it begins. We will not falter at the gates—we will break them open."

 AD5_conquest_of_jotunnborg_title:0 "The City of Giants"
 AD5_conquest_of_jotunnborg_desc:0 "Jötunnborg is ours—or at least, the banners we fly above on the city walls would suggest as much. Yet conquest is not the same as control, and control is not the same as dominion. The streets still echo with the murmurs of the conquered, the farmlands beyond remain in uncertain hands, and within our own ranks, the wolves have begun to circle. The five Fyrstýrimenn families, whose fleets and forces made this victory possible, now eye Jötunnborg with a different kind of hunger. Its relics, its slaves, its gigantic buildings—all are prizes waiting to be claimed. If left unchecked, their ambitions could tear the city apart before we ever truly hold it. Order must be established, rule cemented, and the great farmlands beyond the walls secured, lest this grand prize wither away in famine and feuding. To feed Jötunnborg is to rule it. To rule it is to reshape it in our own image. Now is the time to put down the sword and raise the sceptre—for we have not merely won a city, we have gained the key to an empire."

 AD5_consolidation_of_kalavend_title:0 "Consolidate the Jötunndalr"
 AD5_consolidation_of_kalavend_desc:0 "To secure Jötunnborg is one thing, but to ensure its longevity, we must turn our eyes to the lands that sustain it—the fertile plains of the Jötunndalr, known to the natives as Kalavend. These farmlands are the lifeblood of the city, but their loyalty is fractured, their hearts still with their old ways. The people of Kalavend resist the rule of foreign hands, and unrest simmers beneath the surface like a volcano ready to erupt. We cannot rule Jötunnborg while the valley remain divided, nor can we allow the city to languish in its disorder. To build a lasting realm, we must bring the Jötunndalr to heel, restoring the flow of food and resources that the city needs to thrive. The people here must bend to our rule, their lands our dominion, their defiance quashed. Only by bringing peace to the Kalavend can we secure a foundation for Jötunnborg to grow into something greater. Hundreds of Hallfreder settler families are already eyeing these rich lands with greed, eager to carve out their own estates. The time is now to take the valley, to set down roots deep within the earth of Jötunndalr and ensure that no rebellion, no unrest, shall ever threaten the might of our realm. Without this consolidation, our victory will be hollow, and the strength of our fledgling empire will be fleeting."

 AD5_welcome_to_the_jungle_title:0 "Welcome to the Jungle"
 AD5_welcome_to_the_jungle_desc:0 "Kykrskógrhjarta, meaning 'Heart of the living forest' is the name our people have given to what seems to be a significant hub of energy, where lots of roots converge. If we are to subdue this forest one day, we'll need to control this hub, and other hubs like it. It also seems like the local Skraeling spend vast time and resource appeasing the Kykrskógr, which they are obsessed with. These sappy treehuggers have been at war with the Orwa'ii for centuries, and do not appreciate us living in the 'wound' of their 'god'..."

 AD5_gauldursstrandir_title:0 "Gauldursstrandir"
 AD5_gauldursstrandir_desc:0 "The coastal grasslands of Gauldursstrandir stand in stark contrast to the arid lands of Brendrótaland—here, unburned roots still thrive. Long ago, Fyrstýrimadr Gauldur Vidarfótr saw promise in these shores and demanded they be settled, but Hallfred denied him time and time again. When Gauldur rose in mutiny, his fate was sealed—he was executed near these very beaches, his ambitions buried with him. Yet the Vidarfótar have never forgotten. To this day, they make secret pilgrimages to his grave, tending to it in the shadows, hidden from the eyes of rival families. Now, the time has come to do what was once forbidden—to settle Gauldursstrandir at last. Whether to honour their fallen founder or simply to get their haven away from the others, the coast shall be tamed, its riches reaped, and its memory woven into the fabric of our realm."

 AD5_gauldursval_title:0 "Gauldursval"
 AD5_gauldursval_desc:0 "The final fields of Gauldursstrandir have been settled. These fertile coastal lands, once dismissed by Hallfred himself, have since proven their worth. Yet their past is steeped in blood and treachery—the name of Gauldur Vidarfótr still lingers like a curse upon the shore. It was here that tensions boiled over, where mutiny and ambition clashed with destiny. Gauldur, the would-be usurper, sought to turn back and claim this land by force, only to be struck down, his body left to rot in an unmarked grave on the beach as the fleet pressed onward. Now, with region firmly in Vidarfótar hands, a regional capital is starting to develop in Gauldursval, the area where the Expedition spent some time on land, and the area where Hallfred and Gauldur had their first shouting match. No longer will this land be known only as the site of a mutineer’s fall—it will become a thriving hub of trade and agriculture, proof that Gauldur’s legacy was not one of folly, but of foresight. The Vidarfótar whisper of reclaiming their fallen forebear’s honour, and righting ancient wrongs... Their ancient grudge has deeply affected their design for the region, and a great wave of Vidarfótar migrants is about to descend upon the region."

 AD5_pearlsguard_goals_title:0 "Stimulate Pluralism"
 AD5_pearlsguard_goals_desc:0 "The Pearlsguards see cooperation as a moral good, and pluralism as a necessity. They believe that only be accepting differences can a prosperous realm be forged."

 AD5_pearlsguard_goals2_title:0 "Abolish Slavery"
 AD5_pearlsguard_goals2_desc:0 "The Vidarfótr seek to maintain and expand the 'institution' of slavery, but it should instead be abolished! Nothing short of complete abolition of the vile system of opression and tyranny will suffice."

 AD5_pe3_title:0 "Tolerant Empire"
 AD5_pe3_desc:0 "A realm divided is a realm doomed to fall. Though our people come from different lands, speak different tongues, and follow different ways, diversity is our strength. By fostering tolerance among our subjects, we replace strife with stability and discord with prosperity. When all hands work towards a common future, our halls will be filled with wealth, our fields with bounty, and our ships with eager crews. Strength is not found in blood alone, but in the will to stand together. Such is the Pearlsguard way."

 AD5_skalir_goals_title:0 "Skalir Privileges"
 AD5_skalir_goals_desc:0 "The Skalir have shown that we can earn our keep through other means than Reaving alone. They have been trading with the Langeyru for centuries, and could use some stimulus..."

 AD5_skalir_goals2_title:0 "Skalir Trade Networks"
 AD5_skalir_goals2_desc:0 "We must continue to grow our trade networks, ensuring that the Skalir enjoy the most lucrative trading opportunities."

 AD5_sk3_title:0 "Trade Empire"
 AD5_sk3_desc:0 "Trade is the true lifeblood of our economy, not Reaving. Our Skalir merchants now sail to ports so far that even Hallfred would be proud. We have to protect our merchants against the interests of other Fyrstýrimenn and traders from other realms. "

 AD5_divenscourge_goals_title:0 "A Grand Expedition"
 AD5_divenscourge_goals_desc:0 "Like Hallfred himself, we shall once more venture into the grand unknown and search for distant lands; A grand expedition must be organized!"

 AD5_divenscourge_goals2_title:0 "Reestablish Contact"
 AD5_divenscourge_goals2_desc:0 "Our ancestral lands of Cannor and Gerudia are of great interest to us. Many men reminisce about the past, bringing up ancient tales and facts... What greater adventure than to reconnect with our ancient homeland, across the vast seas!"

 AD5_di3_title:0 "Adventurous Empire"
 AD5_di3_desc:0 "Our Fledgling Empire was birthed from the drive to adventure, and that tradition shall be kept alive at all cost! Men flock to the army, colonial settlements and adventuring parties. They crave adventure, carrying that same wanderlust that Hallfred Henriksson Divenscourge did."

 AD5_svartskegg_goals_title:0 "A Skald Tower"
 AD5_svartskegg_goals_desc:0 "The Svartrskeggs have been operating from huts, hovels and houses carved into the burned roots of Hallfredhavn. Ancient tales from gerudia tell of so called Skald Towers that serve as hubs for the many tasks a Skald has: Training new Skalds, practicing magic, and writing, among others."

 AD5_svartskegg_goals2_title:0 "School of Skalds"
 AD5_svartskegg_goals2_desc:0 "The realm has need of a grand school, where hundreds of Skalds can get an education simultaneously. This will undoubtedly help them help us... Now to pick a suitable location."

 AD5_sv3_title:0 "Skald Empire"
 AD5_sv3_desc:0 "Without Tales we know nothing, without history we are no-one, without magic we are mundane. Skalds are the very liveblood of our society, and the epitome Gerudian tradition. We may be isolated from the other Skaldhyrric adherents, but with enough skalds, do we really need anyone else?"

 AD5_vidarfotr_goals_title:0 "Promote Slavery"
 AD5_vidarfotr_goals_desc:0 "Slavery is a controversial subject in Hallfreder society, but the Vidarfótr see it as follows: The weak should fear the strong. They should work the fields whilst we Reave and feast.\nThe less slaves, the more we should Reave... The more slaves, the more we can feast."
 
 AD5_vidarfotr_goals2_title:0 "Vidarfótr Raids"
 AD5_vidarfotr_goals2_desc:0 "Whilst Reaving rich lands, it is inevitable that a Reaver begins to not only desire the riches, the women and the food of the land, but also the land itself. With this new age of Reaving, various adventurers have tried to settle small reaver states and outposts, with varying results. It has become a well documented fact however, that if a Reaver likes what he sees, he might very well stay."
 
 AD5_vi3_title:0 "Slaver Empire"
 AD5_vi3_desc:0 "Slavery has become accepted in our realm, and the Pearlsguards have largely given up. The Vidarfotr know what is good for the realm and for themselves. The Langeyru cannot be trusted to govern themselves, they need us as much as we need them."

 AD5_flatey_settlements_title:0 "Settling Flatey"
 AD5_flatey_settlements_desc:0 "To the south of Hallfredhavn lies Flatey, a virgin island untouched by the hands of settlers. Its flat (hence the name), safe and fertile lands make it a prime target for expansion. By establishing a settlement here, we secure new farmland, extend the reach of our fishermen and whalers, and a vital stepping stone for future ventures. The first longhouses must rise, the first fields must be sown, and the first hearths must be lit—Flatey shall be ours."

 AD5_sunnarhofn_title:0 "Jötunnhofn"
 AD5_sunnarhofn_desc:0 "On the shores of Sunnarhöfn, buried beneath the overgrowth and the sands of time, settlers have uncovered something extraordinary. A shipyard, vast and ancient, built by the Jötunn of old. Its timbers, though weathered, speak of a forgotten age when giants roamed the seas on ships the size of cities. With skilled hands and determination, we shall restore this grand edifice, reforging it into a bastion of shipbuilding. No mere fishing boats or traders shall be born here—only mighty vessels, worthy of Jötunnkind, fit to rule the waves and strike fear into those who would stand against us."

 AD5_flatey_domination_title:0 "Dominate Flatey"
 AD5_flatey_domination_desc:0 "Flatey is no longer a mere virgin island—it is a battleground of wills. Others have come, seeking to stake their claims upon its fertile shores and sheltered harbours, but there is no room for rivals on this beautiful island. If we are to secure this isle as our own, we must push out all foreign settlers, root and stem, until none remain but those who swear fealty to us. Only then will Flatey be truly ours, its lands tilled by our hands, its waters sailed by our ships, and its riches feeding only our ambitions."

 AD5_flatey_prosperity_title:0 "Attract Immigrants"
 AD5_flatey_prosperity_desc:0 "The bountiful isle of Flatey stands as a testament to our triumph—a land fertile, secure, and brimming with promise. No longer a distant and untamed shore, it is now a haven for all those who tire of war. It is time to send word to Cannor and Gerudia, to call upon the bold and the willing, those who would follow in the footsteps of Hallfred and sail west. Let them know that here, prosperity awaits, and that those share our blood, wanderlust and determination shall find a new home beneath our banner."

 AD5_brendrotaland_rivers_title:0 "The Rivers of Brendrótaland"
 AD5_brendrotaland_rivers_desc:0 "Brendrótaland, our homeland of burned roots and hardship, holds untapped potential within its ashen soil. Though largely devoid of rainfall, its rivers—the Árvár, Vestrá and Austrá—remain as lifelines, winding through the parched expanse. Yet, they are choked with debris, their shallow waters difficult to navigate to even our shallow draughted ships. If we are to bring true prosperity to these lands, we must carve pathways through the silt and stone, making the rivers navigable. With ships coursing through these waters and the fertile heart of Brendmidja properly cultivated, Brendrótaland can be transformed from a land of struggle into a thriving region of agriculture and commerce. Where others see only ruin, we shall forge renewal."

 AD5_brendrotaland_defense_title:0 "Brendrótaland Defense"
 AD5_brendrotaland_defense_desc:0 "Though the rivers of Brendrótaland now flow freely, bringing trade and agriculture to the land of burned roots, its wealth remains fragile. The mountain passes that surround the region stand open, leaving it vulnerable to the devastation of war. No merchant will invest in trade, no landholder will build, and no businessman will dare plant their roots if the spectre of invasion looms over them. By fortifying the key passes we shall secure Brendrótaland from outside threats. Only then will the land truly develop, and only then will the rich and powerful see it as a land worth investing in."

 AD5_the_blooming_title:0 "The Burning and Blooming"
 AD5_the_blooming_desc:0 "The cursed roots of Kykrskógr stir, from the jungle come crashing beasts and Skraeling  covered in spores and plants, attacking settlers like rabid dogs, the roots twist like grasping fingers, and those who wander too far into its shadowed embrace do not return. The Oono'i warned us this has happened before and would happen again, they burned the roots in our shared homeland for this very reason. It is time to meet its darkness with unrelenting fire. The Oono'i waged war upon this woodland long ago, knowing that only through total devastation could its horrors be silenced. We must learn from their wisdom. Fire mages shall march with our armies, their flames turning trees to ash and roots to burnroot. We shall not merely cut back the forest—we shall erase it, until all that remains is the land of burned roots, barren but conquered, lifeless but tamed. The deathwar has begun, and this time, there will be no retreat."

 AD5_the_burning_title:0 "Complete the Burning"
 AD5_the_burning_desc:0 "The deed is done. The Kykrskógr has been dealt a deathblow. The Jungle has been turned into a sea of Burnroot, and the effelai is now jokingly called North-Brendrótaland by Hallfreders. The burned roots stretch all the way to the Heart of the Kykrskógr in [2378.GetName]. As the heart of the jungle burns, the age of war against the Kykrskógr draws to a close and the sons and daughters of Hallfred can go home to celebrate Landingsday with their family."

 AD7_blamennland_foray_title:0 "Blámannaland Foray"
 AD7_blamennland_foray_desc:0 "With the subjugation of the Skegglands in full swing, new avenues for wealth creation are needed to fuel the ever-growing military. The nearby Andic Reach, with its crown jewel Ameion, comes to mind to Reavers, traders and generals alike. An obvious target, but the way that target should be approached is up for debate. The Skalir wish to establish Trade Protectorates, the Vidarfótar would see them pay tribute and others yet would see them conquered outright... Which way, Hallfreder?"

 AD7_blamennland_wars_title:0 "Blámannaland Wars"
 AD7_blamennland_wars_desc:0 "With the successful campaign of the Andic Reach behind us, the hungry gaze of Hallfreders fixates upon the western isle of Blámannaland, full of filthy rich cities just begging to be raided. The logistics of these raids are complex however, and would be greatly aided by some local outposts. To that end we should claim some of the Cleaved Sea Islands and lay the foundation for future raids!"

 AD7_armringrskipan_title:0 "Armringrskipan"
 AD7_armringrskipan_desc:0 "The feudal-esque system of the Hallfreders, revolving around Armrings and the oaths that go with them, has been standardised more and more these past few decades. As Vassals swear oaths to their overlord and receive their Armrings, the material type of the Ring now has a more pronounced meaning than before. Previously a beautiful or expensive Armringr was just a way to flaunt wealth or status, but now even certain privileges can be derived from it.

We have fought, we have conquered, and we have carved. The great wars, hunger and strife that once consumed us now smoulder in the past, their embers fading as the future looms bright before us.

 hallfredhavn.2.d:0 "The Sidrvetr, which translates to Long Winter in the common tongue, is best described as a centuries-long period of national decay. Starting around 1100 AA with the abolishment of the monarchy following the Black Rebellion, the government of Hallfredhavn has been inert due to deep rooted divisions. \nRivalries between houses, clans, religions and even races have left the Thing unable to deal with growing shortages. As some vital goods become increasingly rare and the powers that be further entrench their privileges, failed harvests and ethnic violence lead to massive unrest. \nThe Ófárár, meaning disaster year, marks the year of 1443 AA, which had the worst crop harvest in centuries, as pestilence poisons the fields and farmers work with stone tools.\n\nSeveral granaries has been raided, some poor folk have already starved to death. Men of fighting age assemble into bandit gangs, neighborhood watches, Noble lapdogs and ethnic or religious fanatics. \nWho will put an end to this madness?"

Their villages are entirely constructed out of tents, meaning they must migrate from time to time.

We were forced to leave the mage behind and Hallfred decided to travel eastward.\n\nEast of the singing savages laid a great swamp, only comparable to the great swamps of Estridstadr. In it dwelled men with pitch black skin and large circular mouths. They attacked on sight and threw spears at us as we sailed deeper into this gargantuan swamp. That is where we were attacked by a swarm of swampleeches, some as big as a man. We fought them off, until one appeared that dwarfed his brothers with ease, forcing us to row to land. It sunk the Small Pearl, forcing Anna and her crew to swim to shore, losing many to the leeches.

In this year Hallfred's first and only son Hrafn Hallfredsson Divenscourge was born, to his lover Greta. \n\nThe new ship, named the 'Pararu' in honor of our hosts, was finished in the year 915 AA, and so we departed from Pararu, and defied the swamp once more, back from whence we came. \nThe Expedition was having its effects on us, many had died from disease & beasts, and some voiced their regret joining on the journey."

Their now dead father Hrafn had written a letter on his deathbed, saying that since he expected his sons to fight for the throne, they might as well make it official. Thus there was a grand Duel for the title of Jarl of Hallfredhavn.

It is strange to see Halflings so far from where the Skalds tell us they roamed centuries ago, and to see them so unlike they've been described. They are somewhat hostile but not plentiful enough to offer any real resistance. Reports of passing Halfling ships and reports of larger landmasses suggest that there exist more advanced Halfling societies not far from the colony."

They also report of a desert of blue sands, which the blue men seemed to be very wary of. They report to have settled near an estuary which also has a natural harbor, and are looking forward to more settlers. They say the land is arid like our own Brendrótaland. There are Langeyru natives, but they seem unorganised and and not all that aggressive."

 hallfredhavn.78.d:0 "As Hallfreder Reavers plunder the incredibly prosperous cities, towns and temples around the Jotunnsstraumr estuary, which the locals call the Kalavend, incredible amounts of loot is carried to the ships. When the ships leave for Hallfredhavn, many men fantasise about one day taking those cities for themselves.\nThe city of Steinjötunnborg, which the Langeyru call Kottar Orenkoraim, holds a crucial part in Hallfreder folklore. Some believe the statue that casts a shadow over the city is in fact a petrified giant, who was tasked with guarding the river behind him. Others believe it to be a piece of Giant art, made long ago by Giants trying to demarcate their territory. Whatever the purpose of this Giant stone man is, the Hallfreders have been obsessed with the statue ever since they first saw it in the 10th century. \nOver time this statue, which is often spotted by fishermen, traders and Reavers, and the Hallfreder travelers who have set foot in Jotunnborg (Nanru Nakar), have caused the Hallfreders to mix ancient Gerudian folklore with these new findings. It has become a common belief among Hallfreders that they themselves carry the blood of Giants, and that the shorter Langeyru have less of a claim to these lands than they do."

It is a great city constructed around an estuary and functions as a major trading hub, in which the primary good happens to be Langeyru slaves. It is also home to a school of magic, making the city one of interest to the Skalir, Vidarfótar and Svartrskeggs respectively. Besides the 'Blue House' magic school and the fortifications that failed to protect the city from Reavers, it is also home to a great many markets. One can buy Langeyru slaves, elixers, Kykrskógrheim plants, and relics from far away lands. A limited offer today: 100% off on all purchases for Hallfreders."

That land has been found, conquered and tamed.\n\nHallfreders have, with support of the government, started building farming settlements in the Kalavand Region, which they call Jötunndalr (Valley of Giants). This has led to tensions in some areas, but a syncretic coexistence in others. As Hallfreders take on Langeyru wives and husbands, a new demographic begins to form alongside these settlers: The Halfkynn, born from interracial couples, these children are often fluent in a Taychendi language alongside either Gerudian or Common, making them natural diplomats in this period of friction."

The Skalir stubbornly refused to decommission the ship and have refit, repaired and renovated it for centuries. What started out as an 8th century Gerudian Longship has evolved into a hulking mass of burnroot. Some don't even call it a ship anymore, and refer to it as a platform or island.

 hallfredhavn.127.t:0 "The Colour of Jötunnheim?"
 hallfredhavn.127.d:0 "What colour best represents Jötunnheim, and should thus be the national colour?\n\nSome argue for keeping the Hallfreder Blue that was present on the flag of Hallfredhavn and the flag of the Divenscourges, whilst others argue for changing to Jötunn Relic Blue, a colour derived from relics dug up from Jötunn sites. Burnroot Black is another popular choice, a colour representing Brendrótaland. Even Pearly White, representing the Pearls found on our old flag..."

 hallfredhavn.133.d:0 "Vidarfótar have been making dangerous journeys to these beaches for centuries to honour their Fyrstýrimadr. Now they go for a different reason-to settle. Every day more and more ships and caravans depart of the Gauldursstrandir, but what are they going to do there?"
 hallfredhavn.133.a:0 "They're probably bringing slaves"
 hallfredhavn.133.b:0 "Farm, probably?"
 hallfredhavn.136.t:0 "The Saltmines of Saltrsandr"
 hallfredhavn.136.d:0 "Saltrsandr is blessed with great amounts of salt, and Saltrsandrby is perhaps the saltiest town on this continent.\n\nNot all is well however, as landowners squabble over mining rights, sabotage each others salt pits and even fight to the death over salt. Salt is essential in the preservation of meat and fish, and as such of vital importance to the surival of the Hallfreders in these trying times. Previous Things have tried in vain to implement measures to increase salt production, but success has eluded them. Some in the Thing are for turning some of the salt pits into state property, while others would rather deploy more guards to the reason."
 hallfredhavn.136.a:0 "We will force the landowners to sell the pits to the state."
 hallfredhavn.136.b:0 "We will deploy more guards to the area."
 hallfredhavn.136.c:0 "The Thing failed to pass either decree."
 hallfredhavn.138.t:0 "The Oono'i Gift"
 hallfredhavn.138.d:0 "A group of Skraeling Oono'i, living out in the wastes, have begun leaving food on the outskirts of Skraelingbaer. According to locals they feel sorry for the local Oono'i, of which many are emaciated and underfed. Now an entire herd of Anakal lies dead on the outskirts of town. The wild Oono'i show not only a great degree of empathy but also skill in hunting and knowledge of local fauna. No Hallfreder would be able to not only bring down a herd of Anakal, but also to drive or herd them to such an ideal and specific location.\n\nAs thankful Oono'i from Skraelingbaer carve out chunks of meat to take home, hungry Hallfreders look on with envy in their eyes..."
 hallfredhavn.138.a:0 "Let the Langeyru have it."
 hallfredhavn.138.b:0 "All inhabitants of Hallfredhavn need this!"
 hallfredhavn.139.t:0 "The Skalir Loan"
 hallfredhavn.139.d:0 "The realm finances are in dire straits. As loans pile up and interest payments begin taking up an increasing amount of wealth, the Skalir see both a crisis and an opportunity. All these centuries, the government has been struggling to get by, whilst the Skalir make hand over fist on trades, in a market where they own the only ship. On the one hand the collapse of Hallfredhavn would have a devastating impact on this rich trading family, but on the other hand it is a chance to make some profits, and perhaps more importantly, gain influence.\n\nShould the government take a loan from the merchants, they will undoubtedly use this favour to strengthen their position in the realm.\nWe do need a financial windfall, but how bad do we need it?"
 hallfredhavn.139.a:0 "A massive loan."
 hallfredhavn.139.b:0 "A medium loan."

 hallfredhavn.140.c:0 "'I'm not paying back shit!'"
 hallfredhavn.142.t:0 "The Hallfreder Thing"
 hallfredhavn.142.d:0 "Carved in 1105 AA\n\nThe Hallfreder Thing is not much unlike the Things back in Gerudia. Leaders of families, clans, companies & guilds will gather, and discuss an issue. Debate persists until a consensus is reached, or it becomes evident that a consensus is impossible. At that point the Thinghöfdingi decides if there will be a vote or if meeting will end. The weight of the votes is decided using a long and complex set of rules that only the Thinghöfdingi and a few elders truly understand. Most power has consolidated in the following positions: Thinghöfdingi, Captain of the Guards, House heads of the Fyrstýrimenn families, the priest of the City Temple & the major landowners."
 hallfredhavn.142.a:0 "Go Back"
 hallfredhavn.143.t:0 "The Reformation of the Thing"
 hallfredhavn.143.d:0 "The Hallfreder Thing has undergone a major overhaul. New rules have been put into place to ensure more representation for less powerful politicians and prevent corruption and Thing-circumventing strategies. The Monarchist factions have had their attempts at the restoration of the Jarldom curbed, and are now forced to participate in the Thing once more, further bolstering its legitimacy."
 hallfredhavn.143.a:0 "Go Back"
 hallfredhavn.144.t:0 "The Restoration of the Jarldom"
 hallfredhavn.144.d:0 "The Jarldom has been restored. The corrupt and innefective Thing has been abolished and the natural order of our society has returned. It took centuries, but normalcy has returned. May is never depart again. Long live the Jarl!"
 hallfredhavn.144.a:0 "Go Back"
 hallfredhavn.145.t:0 "The Conquest of Jötunnborg"
 hallfredhavn.145.d:0 "Jötunnborg has been conquered. It took the bravery and sacrifice of many brave warriors, but even gargantuan walls built by the Jötunn themselves are no match for our ladders, mages, riverborne siege works and Reavers. For centuries our sailors, merchants and Reavers have enviously stared at those walls, knowing that a city built by Jötunn must hold riches and wonders far too great to let these Langeyru Skeggmenn manage."
 hallfredhavn.145.a:0 "Go Back"
 hallfredhavn.146.t:0 "The Jötnabörnin Generation"
 hallfredhavn.146.d:0 "The crucible of war and circumstance forges every generation of men in a different way. The generation coming into full adulthood now grew up with not just the dream of conquering Jötunnborg, but a lot were actually on the frontline, scaling those gigantic walls. This shared experience has brought forth a generation of particularly motivated and involved men, who are eager to shape this new world to their own image, and to make their ancestors proud. It befalls now upon the state to use these men, lest the Jötnabörnin generation goes to waste."
 hallfredhavn.146.a:0 "A generation of warriors"
 hallfredhavn.146.b:0 "A generation of wise men"
 hallfredhavn.146.c:0 "A generation of administrators"
 hallfredhavn.147.t:0 "Jötunnborg, Finally"
 hallfredhavn.147.d:0 "It has taken centuries, but finally Hallfreders setting foot in Jötunnborg come not as traders, but as conquerors! When the first Hallfreders that laid eyes upon this magnificently gargantuan city, they were instantly obsessed. Many men would undergo the long journey from Hallfredhavn to Jötunnborg, along the coast and over the Jötunnsstraumr, just to stand where the giants once lived. This city, that has undoubtedly been forged by the hands of giants, has long been in the hands of Skegglanders, who do not appreciate the truly gigantic walls that kept them safe. That changes today, as the Hallfreders remind the Skeggmenn that change is inevitable, and that the weak should fear the strong."
 hallfredhavn.147.a:0 "Jötunnborg will be ours!"
 hallfredhavn.148.t:0 "Stability Brings Prosperity"
 hallfredhavn.148.d:0 "As hunger becomes a memory, order returns to the land. Commoners have become less selfish, less prone to theft, hoarding and other detrimental behaviour. The wealthy and landowners have started selling their food reserves, now that the prices are still high, but the immiment threat of starvation is over. Daring to invest once more, farmers have started using the best possible tools for the job, and as a result Hallfredhavn is producing more food than ever!"
 hallfredhavn.148.a:0 "The Sidrvetr will soon end..."

 hallfredhavn.1001.t: "Food Census of [GetYear]"
 hallfredhavn.1001.d: "Food security during the Sidrvetr is not guaranteed, in fact malnutrition and even starvation are real issues for the working class. As fishermen, traders, hunters and farmers try to keep society afloat, some have lost all hope and have sunk to thievery and banditry.\n\nIf our §YNational Food Stockpile§! were to reach §R0§!, we might become one with the Oono'i Skraeling, scavenging for food in a stateless society.\n\nYou can temporarily increase your food stockpile by going on §YGreat Hunts§!, using the §YStadfastr§! to fish or trade for food or by using the Plant Growth spell (The stronger the Mages influence the better the effect).\n\nTemporary measures are not enough however, as our society is at a real risk of destruction if the material conditions do not improve. More lasting changes come from:\nDecreasing theft by lowering the average national unrest.\nIncreasing base production development in fish, grain and livestock provinces.\nObtaining new fish, grain and livestock provinces.\nIncreasing fishing efficiency by ending the Wool Shortage.\nIncreasing farming efficiency by gaining better seeds through the Skeggland Trade mission.\nIncreasing both fishing and farming efficiency by reviving metallurgy and also by abolishing the Metal Rationing Nobility Privilege.\nLowering preventable spoilage by increasing base production development in salt provinces."

 string_start_hallfredhavn:0 "§g"I tire of these seas, let us search out a new one."\n-Hallfred Henriksson Divenscourge to his friend Thamur in 903 AA.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nHallfredhavn is a struggling city state on the Dry Coast of Aelantir, founded by the remnants of an expedition during the §YEra of Black Ice§! (768 - 978 A.A.) by Reavers from Gerudia, the Kingdom of the Pearl (Pearlsedge) and the Divenhal Kingdom (A Reaver realm centered around Eborthil). The Expedition was led by Hallfred Henriksson Divenscourge, the second son of the legendary Reaver Henrik Divenscourge. They persevered through a troublesome journey and ultimately settled this coast of burned branches (Brendrótaland). No other Reaver fleet has sailed to such distant shores. The city state itself, along with its ancient dynasty and capital, owes its name to this ancestry.\nThe expedition that brought forth Hallfredhavn had five ships, each hailing from a different part of the Gerudian diaspora, leading to a diverse religious composition: The dominant Skaldhyrrics form the majority, but Cannorian Pantheon adherents are plentiful too.\n\nThrough the generations the Hallfreders have adapted to the strange Brendrótaland (Dry Coast) environment, where no rain falls, and burned branches cover the land, varying from regular to a size so large one could carve mansions into it, which the inventive Gerudians have. \nExploring their surroundings, they came into contact with the Langeyru, strange people with long ears. They also found seas with plentiful fish and beyond that, a distant land (Taychend) inhabited by Langeyru (Ruinborn) far more advanced than the Skraeling of the Brendrótaland. These bearded Langeyru, dubbed Skegglanders, occupied a city (Nanru Nakar) so grand it could only have been built by the Jötunn (Giants) of old... \n\n§OAncient History§!\nThe Hallfreders are their own worst enemy, the five Fyrstýrimenn had different opinions on how to organise a state, and their descendants have kept that tradition alive. As factions vied for power, abolishing institutions and staging revolts, the material conditions of the settlement deteriorated every generation. Metal became exceedingly rare, the Monarchy was replaced by a corrupt and regularly sabotaged Thing (Assembly) and the food supply dwindled as farmers lacked good seeds and metal tools, whilst fishing ships lacked wool for their sails.\n\n§ORecent History§!\n1443 AA marks one of the worst years in Hallfreder history, as a crop failure reveals the cracks in society. Beggars & thieves roam the streets, stealing food from hungry commoners, bandits gather in the hinterlands, and the Skraeling Slaves stare at the abyss as even their masters grow skinny. Noble houses gather in the dark to discuss schemes, granaries have more guards than workers, and the Thing is more divided than ever."

 hallfreder_ace_1_burnwood_reavers: "Burnroot Reavers"
 hallfreder_ace_1_burnwood_reaversDESCR: "The Hallfreder military has never had enough metal to create new armour, so the men opted for what they could find, that could be metal armour passed down generations, leather armour, or in most uniquely: Burnroot, taken from the many dead burned roots of the Effelai found in the Dry Coast. Not incredibly effective or conductive of mobility or stealth, Burnroot Armour would eventually be phased out.\n\nMost men carried axes, in various shapes and sizes. One handed axes were decently popular but were as often thrown as they were held. Long axes were a more popular pick. Swords and shield were very common and bows were prevalent too. The designs of these weapons were largely based on Gerudian and Cannorian designs from around 904 AA, which is when the Hallfreders left for Aelantir."

 hallfreder_ace_1_mounted_fyrstyrimenn: "Mounted Fyrstýrimenn"
 hallfreder_ace_1_mounted_fyrstyrimennDESCR: "The Expedition did not bring horses or other mounts, so for the longest time mounts were an incredible luxury in Hallfreder society. There are mounts to be found in the dry coast, but they are either rare or... unorthodox. The Taychend had horses, that occasionally could would roam the Dry Coast and end up in Hallfreder hands, but were not succesfully bred until the late 15th century. Other mounts included the Anakal, a horned beast home to the Dry Coast and East-Taychend, Millipedes and Centipede, which called the Effelai their home and were also used as mounts by the Thavo'i Ruinborn. In any case, having a mount was a true privilege, and usually reserved for those of noble blood."

 hallfreder_ace_5_cannorian_formations: "Cannorian Formations"
 hallfreder_ace_5_cannorian_formationsDESCR: "When the Hallfreders set out on their expedition, they brought with them Cannorian military theory, which no man on South Aelantir had ever encountered before. These formations, strategies and theories allowed them to combat the Taychendi and Kheionai with reasonable success."

 hallfreder_ace_5_langeyru_auxilaries: "Langeyru Auxiliaries"
 hallfreder_ace_5_langeyru_auxilariesDESCR: "The Langeyru (Long-Ear) Auxiliaries at the time mainly consisted of Oono'i footmen, Taychendi mercenaries, slaves raided from the surrounding areas and the occasional Kheionai or primitive wanderer. These soldiers were used differently depending on their ethnicity, as the Oono'i functioned mainly as scouts, guides and rangers of the Dry Coast, whilst Taychendi and primitive units were mainly used in their respective homeland, as no Hallfreder could blend into or independently navigate ruinborn society. In combat these units were usually used as shock troops or flanking units."

 hallfreder_ace_6_hallfreder_anakal_riders: "Anakal Riders"
 hallfreder_ace_6_hallfreder_anakal_ridersDESCR: "The Anakal, a large type of quadripedal herbivore mammal with thick grey skin and a most peculiar mouth flanked by tusks, was used more and more as a mount starting in the 1470s, after successful domestication led to a population boom. The beast would usually be slightly larger than a horse, and if sufficiently trained, could charge through most military units, except for maybe the Kheionai Phalanx."

 hallfreder_ace_6_hallfreder_horse_archers: "Hallfreder Horse Archers"
 hallfreder_ace_6_hallfreder_horse_archersDESCR: "Horse Archery started developing in the Taychend, and when the Hallfreders lost some battles to them, they quickly adapted by adopting a similar practice. This also required the bowyers to start making bows more similar to the Taychendi, as Taychendi recurved tips and composite designs were more suited to firing from horseback."

 hallfreder_ace_9_arqubusier_shieldwall: "Arquebus Shieldwalls"
 hallfreder_ace_9_arqubusier_shieldwallDESCR: "Rudimentary firearms have started to become popular in Cannor, and through the intercontinental trade that started after the rediscovery of Aelantir by the rest of the Cannorians, these arms made their way into Hallfreder hands. They started to replace bows, and quickly found a new strategy: By forming a shield wall to protect reloading gunmen, and by using a shorthand language, shieldbearers could quickly create holes in the wall for the gunmen to fire through, and then fill that hole again with a shield, as the gunman starts the arduous reloading process. These firearms were the first firearms the enemies of the Hallfreders ever encountered, and as such they were very frightening."

 hallfreder_ace_9_blamenn_phalanx: "Blámenn Phalanx"
 hallfreder_ace_9_blamenn_phalanxDESCR: "After seeing the staggering victories won by the Ameion armies on the Taychend subcontinent, the not just the Taychendi, but also the Hallfreders began mimicking their military formations. The Kheionai were known for using incredibly long spears, and have been documented to have used square and line formations, devastating cavalry and denying infantry the ability to advance. The Hallfreders did not all wield to these long spears, but instead opted for a line of men with long spears at the front of the army, repositioning, consolidating or spreading out if needed, to catch the enemy cavalry before it could harm the spearless units."

 hallfreder_ace_10_anakal_platforms: "Anakal Platforms"
 hallfreder_ace_10_anakal_platformsDESCR: "The Anakal, a large type of quadripedal herbivore mammal with thick grey skin and a most peculiar mouth flanked by tusks, has been used as a mount for some time now. A new invention called an 'Anakal Platform' consists of constructing a burnroot platform on the back of the beast, and fastening it with belts. This allows a rider, and if the size of the Anakal permits it, some passengers, to take cover from enemy fire, and also have stable footing whilst aiming their own ranged weapons. This forces enemies to engage with the Anakal itself, which is quite difficult due to the aforementioned thick skin and tusks."

 hallfreder_ace_10_mounted_riflemen: "Mounted Riflemen"
 hallfreder_ace_10_mounted_riflemenDESCR: "As more advanced rifles made their way into South Aelantir, the Hallfreders were some of the first independent people to adopt them. Their close trade contacts with Pearlsedge and Gerudia allowed them to purchase enough rifles to kit out a significant portion of their cavalry, who would use the rifles to pick off high value targets at a safe distance. They allegedly used the backs of their horses to balance their guns on, and plugged the ears of their horses so they wouldn't spook so much. These mounted riflemen were notoriously hard to defeat in the flatlands that the Hallfreders inhabited, as a single skilled rifleman could harass an enemy unit for days, whilst keeping a distance insurmountable by Aelantiri bows."

 hallfreder_ace_12_bradskipan: "Brádskipan"
 hallfreder_ace_12_bradskipanDESCR: "Brádskipan, meaning Molten Formation, refers to the blending of various tactics, ethnicities, arms and units into well-rounded regiments that could surmount almost any challenge. By ensuring that every regiment has people of every ethnicity present in the Hallfreder realm, they were never without guides, translators or locals. By letting Hallfreders and Ruinborn fight with the weapons they felt comfortable with, a more skilled but somewhat chaotic army was formed, it was up to the regiment leaders to find order in that chaos."

 hallfreder_ace_12_mixed_firearm_infantry: "Mixed Firearm Infantry"
 hallfreder_ace_12_mixed_firearm_infantryDESCR: "Due to a lack of large scale firearm production in the region, the Hallfreders depended on Cannorian imports, which led to a wide variety of firearms being in use simultaneously. By grouping men based on what type of firearm they had, the regiment leaders could make use of the range, firerate and versatility of their men to an exceptional degree."

 hallfreder_ace_14_brendrotaland_rangers: "Brendrótaland Rangers"
 hallfreder_ace_14_brendrotaland_rangersDESCR: "Brendrótaland, as the Hallfreders call the Dry Coast, was too thinly populated in most regions to have a permanent garrison. Instead, a new profession of mounted rangers arose, who guarded settlements and carried out the law. During times of war these rangers would be call upon and were said to have been exceptionally skilled with pistols, revolvers rifles, bows and throwing axes."

 hallfreder_ace_15_hallfreder_guard: "Hallfreder Guard"
 hallfreder_ace_15_hallfreder_guardDESCR: "As the Hallfreders grew in numbers, so did their army. It was then that the national guard was formed, which led to much more standardized infantry regiments. They often wore dark blue coats and had chainmail under their outer clothing. The weaponry they had was still imported, but certain manufacturers in Cannor and the Dry Coast started providing most arms, leading to a less chaotic logistic system."

 hallfreder_ace_18_daudberars: "Daudberars"
 hallfreder_ace_18_daudberarsDESCR: "Daudberars, or Death Bearers, were cavalrymen that were sent behind enemy lines to disrupt the chain of command & supplies whilst harassing enemy artillery. These units were great flankers and usually boasted the most kills after any land battle, hence the name. They tended to carry several pistols, in their coats and on their belts, allowing for the rapid firing of rounds without reloading."

 hallfreder_ace_19_burnwood_riflemen: "Burnroot Riflemen"
 hallfreder_ace_19_burnwood_riflemenDESCR: "As the Hallfreder industry finally managed to meet the demand of the army, a new rifle became dominant in the Hallfreder army: The Skalirskot, named after the renowned Skalir Fyrstýrimenn family, of which a member called Bjarnar was the designer of the rifle. Other rifles and pistols filled Auxiliary roles in the army, but almost all were at least partially made from burnroot, hence the name. These riflemen regiments were rather modern for their time and have proven effective against even colonial forces."

 hallfreder_ace_23_hallfreder_beast_cavalry: "Beast Cavalry"
 hallfreder_ace_23_hallfreder_beast_cavalryDESCR: "A bit of a misnomer, as horses still made up the majority of mounts in the Hallfreder army. The period saw a marked increase in the amount of beasts other than horses and Anakal, largely owing to the increased presence of Hallfreders in the Effelai jungle. These beast mounts included Centipedes and Milipedes, among even stranger ones. The Taychendi and Colonials feared these regiments, as many of those beasts were as ferocious as their riders, and some had shells or exoskeletons thick enough to stop bullets."

 hallfreder_ace_23_linumenn: "Linumenn"
 hallfreder_ace_23_linumennDESCR: "As military advisors from Cannor, (especially Pearlsedgers) helped modernize the Hallfreder army, they adopted the Line formation that was popular at the time in Cannor. It proved effective against their neighbours, but taming the spirit of a Hallfreder, and forcing him to stand in a line instead of charging, was said to have been quite the task."

 hallfreder_ace_26_sprengimenn: "Sprengimenn"
 hallfreder_ace_26_sprengimennDESCR: "Sprengimenn, meaning Exploding Men, were grenadiers attached to Linumenn regiments, who carried a vast array of bombs & grenades for combat use. Ranging from smoke bombs to shrapnel grenades, these balls of death struck fear into their less technologically advanced neighbors. Some explosives were imported, others were fashioned by local guilds, such as the Svartrskeggs, who are experts in fire magic. These men were especially good at taming the Effelai, as fire grenades could burn like no other."

 hallfreder_ace_28_diversified_mounts: "Diversified Mounts"
 hallfreder_ace_28_diversified_mountsDESCR: "As mounts from all over Aelantir became more prevalent in the region, and magic and artificery made the taming and domestication of otherwise unwieldy beasts feasible, the percentage of horses in the military went down. Cavalry became less about flanking and more about shocking the enemy and creating chaos where it was needed. And what creates more chaos than a Taychendi Giant Sloth?"

 hallfreder_ace_30_ebonsteel_expeditioners: "Ebonsteel Expeditioners"
 hallfreder_ace_30_ebonsteel_expeditionersDESCR: "The special forces of the Hallfreders, the Ebonsteel Expeditioners, are feared by their enemies. Numerous assassinations and other critical missions on the continent are attributed to them, but not a single one has ever been captured alive. As the name implies these units will use Ebonsteel armour and weaponry, and they are capable of wielding artificery, magic and even taychendi relics to get the job done.\nAs Ebonsteel starts seeping into the lower ranks of the military, everyone can feel a bit like an Expeditioner."

 stadfastr_hull:0 "Stadfastr Hull"
 stadfastr_hull_desc:0 "The Stadfastr, a ship as old as history, built somewhere in Gerudia in the 8th century, has been the lifeline of Hallfredhavn for a long time. The Skalir stubbornly refused to decommission the ship and have refit, repaired and renovated it for centuries. What started out as an 8th century Gerudian Longship has evolved into a hulking mass of burnroot. Some don't even call it a ship anymore, and refer to it as a platform or island. One wonders, can a ship that has been refit so many times that no orginal piece remains, really still be the same ship?"
