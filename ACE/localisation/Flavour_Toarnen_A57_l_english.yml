This is a serious field of knowledge that demands thorough study."

It is well enough known that we can organise the Great Chess Tournament of the Anbennar Empire, the first in history. Sixteen countries will participate, sixteen rulers will fight not on the battlefield, but around the same table. Naturally, the Emperor will be invited and hosted with the greatest honours Toarnen can offer. Only one rule will be added to the tournament to prevent cheating: no magic allowed."

 A57_new_settlements_desc:0 "The never-ending stream of Roilsardi settlers is putting a new strain on our duchy – yet another challenge for us to overcome. We have no shortage of virgin lands ready to be claimed by pioneers, but a proud Roilsardi will never be content to live in the woods. Expanding our towns, building new neighbourhoods of small but sturdy log houses, the stone and wood houses by the sea, surrounded by beautiful white cliffs – there is much work to be done, and our time is limited."

For every man who mourns the homeland, thousands respond in unison, creating the most beautiful, sorrowful symphony of souls. But there is a question that few ask - if our homeland was so great, and our hearts still carry the true spirit of Roilsardi, how did we let it happen?

Roilsard, this fabled realm, had endured much under the heavy yoke of the Lorentish beasts, its people bent but never broken, its spirit tested but never extinguished. Even now, as the winds sweep across its craggy hills and ancient streets, the indomitable spirit of the Roilsardi can still be felt, a quiet but unyielding force that whispers of resilience and defiance.\n\nAt last, the time has come to tear down every last reminder of Siloriel's oppressive presence - to tear down the symbols of subjugation and let the past crumble like dust under the weight of a brighter future. A great celebration is upon us, one that will ignite the hearts of Roilsardi and echo through the annals of history. The return of the Crusaders is not just a victory; it is a rebirth, a rekindling of the hope that has long simmered in the shadows. Roilsard, once bowed but now unburdened, stands ready to reclaim its destiny."

The only way to ensure that our homeland will never fall victim to foreign oppression is to strangle any possible opposition in its cradle. Lorentaine has rivalled Toarnaire for too long, a rivalry that will only end with its destruction. Let there be no illusions: this is not a call born of mere revenge, but of necessity. The survival of Roilsard, the preservation of its spirit and its sovereignty, demands nothing less. We must strike with precision and ruthlessness, shattering the foundations of Lorentish power and ensuring that their ability to oppress is extinguished forever. Only then can we breathe freely, knowing that our homeland is safe, our people unburdened by the specter of foreign tyranny. The time for half-measures is over; the time for decisive action is now. The future of Roilsard depends on it."

With the idea of a great crusade against the despicable Arannese culture in mind, the Ducal Court will establish the High Society of the Red Thorn - formally serving as the Crown's envoys, the High Society's true goal lies in their rigorous search for the weaknesses in foreign courts, cultures and their customs."

Secondly, their spouses, because the spark between the loved ones is what will keep Roilsard alive. Our visit to Saloren was a shocking success, as our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] found both.

They are nothing but corrupted versions of Roilsardi - why should we accept to be the lesser version of ourselves?

The zealous nature of the new Roilsardi nobility had spawned the concept of the High Society of the Black Thorn - a society whose official purpose was to manage the relationship between the esteemed Roilsardi noble families and the Crown, but in reality to keep a very close eye on them, with its outposts in every major trading hub of our realm."

flavor_toarnen.1.d: "Nearly ninety years ago, commoners and some nobles led an uprising against Toarnen and called in the Lunar Party to help, almost costing us our independence. They were motivated by the fact that the Síl na Loop dynasty had raised too many taxes and levies in the coastal areas of the duchy over the decades, compared to the previous dynasty, a branch of the Síl Arannen, who were often beholden to the commoners. To appease their anger and prevent war, Duke Alann met with the citizens at Whitecliffs Harbour and conceded a bill that would give each town in our duchy consistent autonomy."

In keeping with our standards, they are all dressed up for the chess competition, wearing beautiful black and white outfits, many of them in plaids made by our own craftsmen. You sit on a wooden throne in the shape of a chess piece, representing a king, and everyone waits for you to start the tournament.
