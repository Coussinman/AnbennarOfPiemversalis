vaengheim_bear_cubs_title: "Bear Den"
vaengheim_bear_cubs_desc: "The Konungrdom of Bjarnrik has seen more stable and prosperous times. After the fall of Black Castanor, Bjarnrik was left isolated from all major trade routes, which led to increased feudal fragmentation as the jarls of Sidaett and Revrhavn strengthened their positions, concentrating banks and the last significant trade routes of the region in their hands. Bjarnrik is nothing more than a paper bear, and with the support of the skalds, it will not be too difficult for us to turn their jarls against each other."
vaengheim_petting_the_bear_title: "House Divided"
vaengheim_petting_the_bear_desc: "The Great Rebellion has left a power vacuum in what once seemed to be a united Konungrdom. The lands and people of Dalr remain frozen in anticipation of a strong ruler who will be willing to achieve what the Bjarnssons could not — to put an end to the centuries-long feudal conflicts of the petty jarls at once and lead Dalr into a new era, an age of greatness and prosperity."
vaengheim_dalr_2_title: "Crown of Ursidae"
vaengheim_dalr_2_desc: "The Crown of Ursidae has been a symbol uniting the people of Dalr for centuries under the direct rule of Konungrhavn. The one who wore it served as a guarantor of stability, a mediator between the Dalric jarls, while also leading them on raids and distributing the spoils among them. The crown was passed down through the sons of Bera, and while this was a wise decision for its time, the Bjarnsson dynasty ultimately failed to rein in the jarls they were meant to lead.\nNevertheless, the Bear Crown remains a foundational symbol in the epic of the dalr people. If we are to truly unite the region under our control, we must become what the Bjarnssons could not. The Dalrics will live, fight, feast, and die — for our Matriarch."
vaengheim_serpentshead_title: "Harbor of Maldorian"
vaengheim_serpentshead_desc: "Beyond the Frozen Pass lies the elven principality of Celmaldor, serving as the symbolic gateway from Gerudia to the Alenic Frontier. In some ways, the elves of Celmaldor are to the Blue Reach what we are to Gerudia — outsiders who have chosen a new home in hopes of shaping their own destinies. Perhaps, with the right degree of persuasion, we can find common ground. Sooner or later, they will come to see the truth in the path of our Sapphire Court."
vaengheim_aelantir_title: "Beyond Gerudia"
vaengheim_aelantir_desc: "The tempest roared, the dark seas groaned,\nNorth Raider wandered, its fate disowned.\nOarsmen strained 'gainst the ocean's might,\nStars were swallowed by endless night.\nFor weeks adrift on the water’s maw,\nThe crew knew naught but the winds’ cold law.\nThen a dawn broke bright on a virgin strand,\nA gleaming jewel of untouched land.\nGold and gems filled their laden hold,\nThe wealth of a world both green and bold.\nHome they sailed with their glory bright,\nYet the path was lost in the endless night.\nNow skalds still sing of the ship and crew,\nOf treasures won and lands untrue.\nFor the North Raider’s course, though lost to men,\nLives on in dreams of the sea again."
vaengheim_sunchasers_title: "Chasing the Sun"
vaengheim_sunchasers_desc: "The legends of faraway lands beyond Cannor have proven true. Forests, mountains, and seas brimming with riches await brave settlers ready to claim them. To maintain control over these overseas territories, we need a special fleet — a fleet capable of projecting our power across the many miles separating the New World from Gerudia."
vaengheim_colony_title: "The Dream Fulfilled"
vaengheim_colony_desc: "The discovery of Aelantir drew countless people of various races in its wake. Each had their own reasons for leaving their homes and venturing into these new, uncharted lands — whether willingly or not. Conflicts soon followed the settlers, just as they had in the Old World. Myriads of causes and consequences became the sparks for the bloodiest battles. Does anyone's dream or the most compelling reason truly justify the blood spilled in these wars?\n— Diary of Chief Explorer Iona Silfrhjart, [GetYear]"

vaengheim_obrtrol_title: "Our Ancient Menace"
vaengheim_obrtrol_desc: "A threat predating even the tales of the White Dragon, trolls serve as a constant reminder of an era when giants roamed freely across Halann, holding Gerudia in their icy grip. With our ambitions to unite Gerudia, it is our duty to begin the slow yet decisive cleansing of the caves in the Dalrvjall Mountains from trolls — a feat no northern ruler has ever truly achieved. Victory over the trolls would be legendary, and skalds will sing of this deed for centuries to come!"
vaengheim_reavers_title: "The Reaver Act of [GetYear]"
vaengheim_reavers_desc: "Since time immemorial, sons of the harsh and unforgiving land have embarked on raids, seeking glory and wealth. Reavers were the driving force of the economy, returning home with untold riches — coins, thralls, and other loot flowing through Gerudia's main ports. In a vain attempt at modernization, the act of reaving was banned by the Bjarnssons in the early 15th century. However, it remained legal in other key ports such as Revrhavn and Redgarhavn, where hereditary reavers still hold most of the wealth.\n\nGerudia is deeply divided over this issue, and any future ruler of the realm will have to address it."
vaengheim_renaissance_mission_title: "Járnklorenessansen"
vaengheim_renaissance_mission_desc: "The ongoing unification of Gerudia could not help but leave its mark on Gerudian culture. The Renaissance of the Cannorians is based on the ideal of the old Damerian Republic, and the main recurrent theme of the new school of skalds from the Iron Renaissance era became the turning towards a future vision of Gerudia, rooted in the imagery of unity from the Black Ice era, in contrast to the previous retellings of individual tales and sagas."
vaengheim_gerudia_centers_of_trade_title: "Rouse, Gerudia!"
vaengheim_gerudia_centers_of_trade_desc: "Our efforts have profoundly shaken the sleepy and measured life of 15th-century Gerudia. Once backwater ports now welcome not only returning captains from raids with thralls and loot, but also merchants from distant lands, eager to purchase goods from the Gerudian Frontier and our overseas territories. Particularly in demand among traders are our oils, which were once merely a necessary tool for survival in Gerudia's harsh climate. For the first time in centuries, Gerudian ports have something to offer the outside world."
vaengheim_storm_isles_title: "Locking the Serpentshead"
vaengheim_storm_isles_desc: "The Storm Islands served as one of the final reaver outposts on the route from Lencenor to Gerudia. Thousands of renowned captains passed through their harbors with ships laden with loot. These islands will yet witness the greatness of the revived Gerudia, and their inhabitants will become a splendid addition to the Sapphire Court."
vaengheim_blue_reach_title: "Blue Reach"
vaengheim_blue_reach_desc: "United with the Maldorian’s Harbor, we have opened the way to the trading cities of the Blue Reach, the main artery connecting Gerudia with Cannor. While usually disunited, their combined potential will give the perfect head start to our growing empire."
vaengheim_moorhills_title: "Hills of Old"
vaengheim_moorhills_desc: "As we moved down the Alen river, we took control of Moorhills, an ancient place of power from our legends, which had seemed forever lost after the Alenic tribes drove us from our homes. A strange sensation fills the mind after encountering a completely foreign place that, at the same time, should feel eerily familiar. At least you hope it's familiar."
vaengheim_real_trade_shit_title: "Land of Wonders"
vaengheim_real_trade_shit_desc: "A small stream of brave pioneers and settlers gave rise to something great. Driven by a thirst for exploration, we conquered Aelantir, the former heart of the precursor elf civilization, and made it the most magnificent gem in our crown."

#branch 3
vaengheim_starting_title: "Call for Unity"
vaengheim_starting_desc: "In all of Gerudia, there are no better friends for us than the skalds. The years of defending Gerudia from the threats of the Frontier, such as the cultists of Elkasael and trolls, truly brought us closer together and secured our representative a permanent place in the Skald Council, deeply respected by all Gerudians despite the centuries of discord among us, which began with the fall of Black Castanor."
vaengheim_gathering_flocks_title: "Gathering Flocks"
vaengheim_gathering_flocks_desc: "The time has come. Answering the skaldic Einleikr Call, we will send messengers to all the harpies in the distant corners of Gerudia, summoning them to Vengheim for the Great March – a long-forgotten tradition, not practiced since the Age of Black Ice. The need for Gerudian unity surpasses the petty ambitions of little jarls."
vaengheim_new_olavlund_title: "The Sapphire Court"
vaengheim_new_olavlund_desc: ""The rapid unification of Gerudia left Vængheim in that typical position of a foreign (albeit not entirely so in this case) conqueror who found himself subjugating vast territories populated by people with foreign cultures and customs. In their aspiration to find common ground with the subjugated populace beneath their heel, the harpies of Vængheim and other dispersed flocks in Gerudia organized into the Sapphire Court — a form of government similar to what can be seen in the harpy flocks of Bulwar. Relying on the skalds as a common denominator, [Z88.Monarch.GetTitle] masterfully navigates the aspirations of different jarls, drawing some closer and pushing others away depending on the situation. Based on the publication of Alain of Aramar from 1645, it can be definitively stated that the political culture of the northerners underwent a significant transformation after the formation of the Sapphire Court, becoming the first modern social contract in the history of Gerudia."\nIsabella of Leslinpár, "Notes on Gerudia", 1682."
vaengheim_olavlund_flavor_title: "Unity and Prosperity"
vaengheim_olavlund_flavor_desc: "An aged man, in the twilight of his years, slowly chops an oak. His days of military glory are long past, yet the thread of his life is far from finished. His eldest son and both daughters gave their lives during the invasion of the Ebonfrosts into Naugsvol several decades ago, but his youngest son showed aptitude for learning and was taken by the skalds to the Sapphire Court in Vængheim. How many sons of Gerudia have given their lives in pointless battles between the jarls? The gray-haired man, in the sunset of his years, continues to chop the oak, unhurried as ever."
vaengheim_human_contacts_title: "Integrating the Skalds"
vaengheim_human_contacts_desc: "The years of close and fruitful work have completely transformed the very nature of our collaboration with the skalds. From spiritual mentors who preferred to offer advice from a distance, they have become one of the main pillars of our Sapphire Court. Deepening our contact is merely the first step in reforging Gerudia into something new."
vaengheim_dev_gerudia_title: "Mountain Paradise"
vaengheim_dev_gerudia_desc: "The rise of the Sapphire Court led to the elevation of the harpies across Gerudia. Many once-disjointed flocks finally found a common purpose, established connections between themselves, and began building majestic nests in the numerous mountains perfectly suited for this task, summoning builders and skalds from all over Gerudia. The organization of each nest seemed, almost unconsciously, to mirror the structure of the Sapphire Court: countless favorites rushed around the matriarch day and night, striving to earn even a fraction of her attention."
vaengheim_skald_council_mission_title: "All-Gerudian Council"
vaengheim_skald_council_mission_desc: "Even since the formation of the Sapphire Court, the skalds have been the cornerstone of our regime, serving as mediators between us, our jarls, and the common people. With the final reform of the skalds around the Skald Council and the granting of special powers to his position, the question of the skalds' future role in the Sapphire Court is more pressing than ever."
vaengheim_alenic_reach_title: "The Iron Reach"
vaengheim_alenic_reach_desc: "Our ambitions do not end on Gerudia. This marks the stepping stone for our greatness, as we are finally ready to test our mettle against Cannorian countries. Let it be known that we, harpies, united the both shores of the Northern Thaw for the first time in ages, something not even Bjarnssons or Ebonfrosts could ever fully dream of."
vaengheim_gawed_title: "Down the Artery"
vaengheim_gawed_desc: "Our desire for control over the River Alen leads us through the lands of the Kingdom of Gawed. A crude and barbaric people, the Gawedi Alenics have tested our patience for long enough. The very course of history gives us the chance to topple their puny kingdom once and for all, and under our leadership, the Alenics will have an opportunity to become something greater."
vaengheim_holy_war_cb_title: "Second to None"
vaengheim_holy_war_cb_desc: "Originating in 584 AA, the Battle Maidens formed the core of Vængheim’s forces, often serving as the sole defenders of our roosts against the wild tribes of forest trolls and various Elkasael cultists inhabiting the Gerudian Frontier. Following the unification of Gerudia and the centralization of power under the Sapphire Court and the Skald Council, the invaluable experience of frontier aerial combat gained by the Warrior Maidens became the foundation of modern Gerudian battle tactics. This innovation reshaped the battlefields of Cannor for centuries to come by adding a new dimension to the traditional pike-and-shot formations of human armies: fearsome aerial harassment tactics.\n\nThousands of forges in the roosts work day and night, preparing to equip our military core with the necessary gear. Might makes right, and our victory is undeniable. Ever since the Age of Black Ice, Gerudia has stood united to show the southerners the true spirit of battle."
vaengheim_imperial_incident_title: "Iron Tower"
vaengheim_imperial_incident_desc: "Overlooking the mouth of the Alen river rises the Black Tower Bal Vertesk, an almost immortal symbol of power. Conquering it and carving our path through the upstart Empire of Anbennar would be a legendary feat, one that would forever etch our names into the sagas of Gerudia, placing us on equal footing with the heroes of old."
vaengheim_incense_mission_title: "Window to Cannor"
vaengheim_incense_mission_desc: "Having conquered Vertesk, we have finally caused the Imperial influence over the northern parts of the Empire to crumble, and we now hold one of the largest ports of Dameshead at our command. Many riches of the southerners are now in our hands, paid for in iron and blood. The Age of Iron has come upon Cannor."
vaengheim_capstone_mission_title: "Age of Iron"
vaengheim_capstone_mission_desc: "As the Empire crumbled, unable to defend its Northern Territories, the world’s attention eventually turned to its conqueror, to the North, culminating in the Bay of Chills. Countless merchant caravans now follow the flow of the Alen River, and our armies march through every city of Cannor and the Lake Federation. The Great Triumph is yours, [Z88.Monarch.GetTitle]. You have truly achieved the impossible."

#branch 4
vaengheim_colonization_start_title: "Call of the Frontier"
vaengheim_colonization_start_desc: "After the Great Flight, we found a new home on the very edge of the Gerudian Frontier. Every inch of this land was paid for in blood. Cultists, trolls, even the very climate—right from the start, all odds were stacked against us. Yet, we thrive. Great challenges spark great fervor, and the more dangerous the Frontier becomes, the more flocks venture further and further eastward. Fortune favors the bold."
vaengheim_gullmork_title: "Legend of the Iron Forest"
vaengheim_gullmork_desc: "Despite its legendary name, Gullmork (the Golden Forest) holds far greater riches than mere gold and silver. Our Frost Wing Prospectors, along with their human assistants, have uncovered significant deposits of iron in the nearby mountains—a practical metal far more valuable in its use than gold. The legend of the Golden Forest has found a new interpretation among us: do not chase fleeting wealth, lest you become blind to the true treasure hiding in plain sight."
vaengheim_urviksten_title: "Black Winter, Iron Hearts"
vaengheim_urviksten_desc: "Urviksten stands as the most formidable jarldom, steeped in fabled history. Ruled by the descendants of the infamous Ebonfrost dynasty, they preside over Ebonfrost Forge, another legendary relic of the past. The Ebonfrosts pose a threat to us—a threat that cannot be ignored—yet their name is deeply intertwined with the tales and destiny of Gerudia, making them one of the most pivotal players in the region... and within our Sapphire Court specifically."
vaengheim_ebonfrosts_title: "Ebonsteel Einherjar"
vaengheim_ebonfrosts_desc: "Even before the tales of the White Dragon, the sons of Gerudia mastered the art of crafting Ebonsteel—a metal blacker than night with truly legendary properties. With the Ebonsteel Forge under our control and the knowledge of the skalds, it is now undoubtedly possible to revive the weapons of old. The enemies of Gerudia will once again learn to fear our ebonsteel-clad soldiers."
vaengheim_taric_title: "Old Oaths, New Oaths"
vaengheim_taric_desc: "Displaced by the Graytide and forced to scatter across Gerudia and the cities of the Reach, the Táric and Cagodic people have long held onto hope of reclaiming their homeland, and our aid would secure their unwavering loyalty. However, the Gray Orcs, though invaders, possess unique fearsome brutality and skills that could make them powerful allies to the Sapphire Court."
vaengheim_vrorenmarch_title: "White Reach"
vaengheim_vrorenmarch_desc: "Much like us, White Reach has been ailing for centuries. From the fall of Black Castanor to the devastation of the Graytide, the people of White Reach remain scattered, their spirits broken as Cannorian vultures circle overhead under the guise of aid and liberation. Our destiny is to free them from their chains, reuniting the White Reachmen with their Gerudian allies."
vaengheim_west_castanor_title: "Graveyard of Chivalry"
vaengheim_west_castanor_desc: "The greatest empire of the Gerudian people, Black Castanor, was reduced to ashes by the petty aspirations of witch-kings and their minions, and their fall caused both Gerudia and White Reach to wane in power. Now, with the fates of Gerudia and White Reach intertwined once more, it is time to move against the chaos and disorder that plague the lands of the former Castanor. The Greentide, adventurers, and remnants — all shall kneel before the Sapphire Court."
vaengheim_krakdhumvror_title: "Those Who Cower"
vaengheim_krakdhumvror_desc: "At the very end of the Northern Pass, where the endless forests meet the ridges of Serpentspine, we discovered traces of a thriving dwarven remnant hold, seemingly having resolved their internal squabbles and freed from the shackles of isolation, reaching outward and meeting us."
vaengheim_krakdhumvror_2_title: "Those Who Prosper"
vaengheim_krakdhumvror_2_desc: "Having the Quartz Dwarves subdued, we have come to know them much better, and they have come to know us. They have endured hardships, and their culture, strict and just, will be an excellent addition to the Sapphire Court."
vaengheim_northern_sea_title: "Relentless Push East"
vaengheim_northern_sea_desc: "Our Relentless Push ended with our arrival on the shores of a new sea to the east. On the horizon, an insurmountable amount of human cities rise, comparable in size to the greatest known cities of Cannor, if not surpassing them. Yet another great conquest to remember us by."

#branch 5
vaengheim_attract_settlers_title: "Joint Efforts"
vaengheim_attract_settlers_desc: "With the ongoing events of Gerudia's unification, more and more people join our ranks, exploring the Frontier. The prospects of starting a new life on the new frontier increasingly attract the strong young generation of Olavish people, both men and women, who prefer frontier endeavors to raiding and pillaging. With our relentless drive for expansion and human courage, it will take but a few generations to fully tame the Frontier."
vaengheim_gerudian_frontier_title: "Sustainable Frontier"
vaengheim_gerudian_frontier_desc: "The Gerudian Frontier has grown sufficiently for various outposts to feel safe, no longer fearing the creatures or troll raids that once plagued them. In these settlements, the production of oils for our scouts is underway, making them more resilient to the harsh weather conditions of the region."
vaengheim_hidden_respite_title: "Black Mountains"
vaengheim_hidden_respite_desc: "Our scouts in the Northern Pass have discovered a network of mountain caves filled with metals suitable for the production of Ebonsteel. It is as if Gerudia herself is sending her faithful children the tools for glorious victories over the outside world. It would be rude to ignore such a gift."
vaengheim_frontier_2_title: "Frontier No Longer"
vaengheim_frontier_2_desc: "The desperate attempts to gain wealth beyond the settled lands of Gerudia have finally borne fruit. Hundreds of outposts, connected by river or lake routes, are thriving and transforming into fully-fledged settlements. The Frontier has become the core."

A messenger from the Council arrived at our roost bearing generous gifts, barrels of ale, and, most importantly, a sealed letter addressed to the high circles of Vængheim. The contents of the letter will remain a secret, but after a brief deliberation, the matriarch emerged with a concise reply."
flavor_vaengheim.1.a: "We will do it for Gerudia."
flavor_vaengheim.1.b: "All Gerudia shall see our might!"

flavor_vaengheim.2.t: "Aftermath of the Conquest"
flavor_vaengheim.2.d: "Uniting Olavslund is but the first step on the path to achieving our grand vision. With its hills and fjords now bound under a single banner, a far more pressing question emerges: what governance best suits their resilient people? Should we cling to the old ways of feudal jarldoms, where strength and loyalty dictate rule, or shall we look to the ideals of the Sapphire Court, blending tradition with innovation to forge something new? The answer will not only shape Olavlund but also echo throughout the future of Gerudia."

flavor_vaengheim.16.d: "A growing merchant class as well as increasingly demanding social code among the nobility and upper classes on top of increasing trade connections with the world beyond Gerudia has lead to an increased demand for our candles and other oil-based products. The halls of grand palaces are now expected to have a likable scent as well as a majestic decor. This has lead to a surge in demand for products such as frankincense, myrrh and other scented products for the making of perfume and in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], the refinement of local oils and scented goods have even grown into a major industry in itself."

flavor_vaengheim.17.d: "The Moorhills were once the ancestral homeland of our kin, a land of rolling hills and ancient traditions, before the Alenic savages drove us from it in a storm of blood and fire. Forced to retreat into the safety of Gerudia, we carried with us the memories of what was lost. Now that we are back, what is the most fitting way of dealing with the memories and tales of old?"

flavor_vaengheim.501.t: "The Emperor's Cowardice"
flavor_vaengheim.501.d: "It had been exactly one year since the Emperor called the Imperial Parliament and a month since our spies learned today would be their invasion day. The Járnklogarðar Battle Maidens commanded by [Z88.Monarch.GetName] stood outside Vertesk, watching the quiet horizon in the whistling wind like hawks. Their ebonsteel armor dimmed even darker as the sun set, all the while awaiting the Empire’s response.\n\nThe city itself had been evacuated, half the population leaving in anticipation of a clash between the Gerudian Eagle and Dove Throne’s armies. Few had hoped war would be avoided, the Járnklogarðar [Z88.Monarch.GetTitle] themselves arriving to oversee the outbreak of conflict.\n\nBut as the sun dimmed, the hopes and morale of the Járnklogarðar forces rose. Not a dove stood in sight of the assembled forces as the shadow of the Eagle loomed over the Damescrown and Alenic Frontier."
flavor_vaengheim.501.a: "In the end, they stood unchallenged."

flavor_vaengheim.502.t: "The Emperor's Threat"
flavor_vaengheim.502.d: "An untouchable, indomitable aura pervaded the court in the weeks and months after the raids of Northern Imperial Frontier. But that veil of invincibility was pierced when a simple damp brown package was brought to the court late one day.\n\nThe advisors of the [Z88.Monarch.GetTitle] crowded around the ruler as the hesitant messenger unveiled the wrapped gift. The courier fumbled the package unceremoniously as it dropped to the floor splattering crimson. It was a severed harpy head, bloodied and dead.\n\n[Z88.Monarch.GetName] roared in anger, demanding who sent such a gruesome item but the deliverer took a long moment for a response. Murmurs and wails went up from the court as the culprit was revealed. \n\nThe package was delivered by a swarm of doves."

flavor_vaengheim.506.d: "The knights of the Orda Aldresia are bodyguards to the Emperor, and should be at their side at all times. But even great warriors can be taken unaware, and when the Battle Maiden flying squad force broke into the imperial palace it caught the Aldresians completely by surprise. As the slaughter of the capital garrison unfolded the fabled knightly order was pushed back inside the palace. Intense fighting hallway by hallway ensued as the legendary knights were slowly separated from the throne room, barricaded within the palace’s shrine.\n\nA new relief force from the imperial princes was supposed to arrive within the hour to shatter the invaders, but none of that would matter if the imperial forces could not hold the capital. If the knights of the Orda Aldresia failed in their duty, all would be lost. \n\nIn one last desperate push, they rallied their brothers and made a single thundering push to the throne room. Cutting through the harpies in a furious whirlwind of steel and shot, the knights rumbled to the broken doors of the throne room and there saw the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Emperor.Monarch.GetHerHis] desperate attempts to hold their ground with a dwindling regiment of the Palace Guard at their disposal. But Aldresian knights didn't manage to come to their Emperor in time, for they were ambushed by human auxiliaries of Battle Maidens infiltrating the palace. The Aldresian Oath remained unfulfilled."
flavor_vaengheim.506.a: "The Dove, torn apart."

flavor_vaengheim.507.t: "Storming of the Impenetrable Roost!"
flavor_vaengheim.507.d: "The Impenetrable Roost of Vængheim stood proud for centuries, fighting off the reaver incursions, cultist raids and monstrous raids alike. However, combined armies of Imperial Electors were not ordinary foe. After months of prolonged siege, imperial artillery rendered roost fortifications useless, and the imperial forces started to break mountainous harpy garrisons one by one. The culmination of the siege happened at the night of [GetDate], when [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the remaining Battle Maidens attempted to catch the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] by surprise in his field camp and succeeding. However, harpies were too outmatched and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] didn't survive the fight. By the start of the morning, the roost inhabitants waived the white flag, marking yet another victory of the Empire of Anbennar."

While small firearms were still carried, the visceral rip and tear of melee was their forte as both shot and steel fail to penetrate the Ebonsteel. Said to have been modeled after armor plans from the Ebonguard of Black Castanor, the Blackjackets carry their legacy with pride and a zealous quest to earn a name even greater!"
