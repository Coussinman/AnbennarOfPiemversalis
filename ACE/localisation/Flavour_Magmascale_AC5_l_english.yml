AC5_heartland_title: "Heartland Guild"
AC5_heartland_desc: "The Buradforge has become our beating heart, a bustling center of industry and kobold life. Yet we must not grow complacent with our current achievements. To truly establish ourselves as a power to be reckoned with, we need a comprehensive guild system that can coordinate our expanding territories and growing population.\n\nThe establishment of the Heartland Guild will serve as the backbone of our administration, bringing together the scattered tribal leaders, industrial overseers, and military commanders under one unified organization. Through this guild, we can ensure that our resources flow efficiently, our workers are properly coordinated, and our expansion efforts are well-planned and executed.\n\nThis is not merely bureaucracy - this is the foundation upon which the great empire of Zutarzira will be built. Every great nation needs strong institutions, and the Heartland Guild shall be ours."

AC5_obsidian_city_title: "Obsidian Capital"
AC5_obsidian_city_desc: "Our capital has grown beyond what any kobold could have imagined in the dark days following the fall of Nimrith. What was once a collection of scattered cave dwellings has transformed into a proper city, yet it still lacks the grandeur befitting the center of our rising empire.\n\nObsidian, that beautiful black glass born from the marriage of stone and fire, shall be the material of our new capital. We have abundant sources of volcanic glass, and our artificers have perfected techniques for shaping it into architectural marvels. The new Obsidian Capital will not only serve as a symbol of our power but also demonstrate our mastery over the volcanic forces that others fear.\n\nWhen foreign dignitaries visit our realm, they shall gaze upon towers of gleaming obsidian that reach toward the cavern ceiling, streets paved with polished volcanic glass, and palaces that reflect the orange glow of our lava channels. They will know immediately that they stand in the capital of a people who have conquered fire itself."

AC5_erect_lavacity_title: "Erect a Lavacity"
AC5_erect_lavacity_desc: "The benefits of urbanization only bless a small corner of the country. Due to our population being spread out, infrastructure, industry and income are mainly concentrated in the capital. This inhibits our growth and creates a great weakness for our nation, for one cannot have fortifications without cities to supply them - and currently, we have no cities.\n\nWe have the resources. Obsidian blocks lie along the roads, workers march out of the capital with tools of iron, steel and mithril, and money is flowing like never before into our coffers. This shall be our nation's first great project, and we shall prove our strength to the world by finishing it."

AC5_feed_people_title: "Feed our People"
AC5_feed_people_desc: "Our biggest issue is our lack of food - a growing population coupled with a lack of a stable food supply is a recipe for disaster, and this disaster has clearly already begun - during war, the lack of imports means many starve to death.\n\nNo food can grow in our environment, and we owe this to ourselves, for we are the ones who flooded it with molten rock. Already, intellectuals from outside powers are describing our land as a desolate territory where nothing will grow, and claim we are ruining ourselves by developing the Lava River. While they are currently right, we can still prove them wrong. This situation will not stand.\n\nLuckily, Nimrith did not create us without minds. Our artificers and bio-engineers have already created heat-resistant plants, and recently some crops have shown an ability to transform heat energy into nutrients. We shall further develop this strain of plants, and workers and prisoners alike shall be put to the task of carving out their farms, in their rightful place along the Lava River."

AC5_soot_goblins_title: "Soot Goblins"
AC5_soot_goblins_desc: "We have much in common with the goblins. We are both considered smallfolk, we were both oppressed by the orcs (though we are now allies with them), and both our peoples have an affinity for industry and artificery.\n\nHowever there is one difference: While they are also newcomers to Bulwar, they have some experience living here. Luckily, many are willing to help us. We would greatly benefit from their aid in ruling the land - the humans would rather be ruled by the devil they know, than the devil they don't.\n\nWe have given them our proposal and theory: Our similarities should lead us to become one people under Zutarzira. They goblins will prosper under our rule and spread along the lava rivers, and our industry and population will grow further.  We will be able to use their most brilliant minds for our projects, allowing an expansion of our artificery."

AC5_questioning_humanity_title: "Questioning Humanity"
AC5_questioning_humanity_desc: "Humanity. A people who have been our enemies since the beginning, and the people who we now triumph over. Our history goes way back - humans opposed Nimrithan control over Khugdihr together with the dwarves, and we have learned that the pale, murderous monster called the Trickster was a human.\n\nIn recent years, our strength grew to such levels that we now overpower and rapidly conquer most human kingdoms, offering them little way to resist. We have ruined their lands by sending a molten wall of lava straight through Bulwar, the cradle of humanity. We match - or outmatch - many of their empires at their heights of power.\n\nWhatever our stance on these humans, they are too many to be ignored. If we wish to integrate them, that is possible - the Lavacities are livable for the heat-intolerant now due to plants absorbing most of the warmth and keeping it at stable levels. We can keep to our current policies of granting them limited local autonomy outside the rivers and putting them under Goblin administration, or actively purge them and settle their lands with kobolds."

AC5_molten_grasp_title: "Molten Grasp"
AC5_molten_grasp_desc: "We have made significant progress in Bahar. Organized resistance continues but is gradually disintegrating. Our forces in the region number approximately 60,000, primarily composed of elite artificer-infantry, supplemented by Moltenbrand auxiliaries to assist in resistance suppression and additional goblin auxiliaries to augment our artificers. We have also deployed around 800 magma cannons. The local Bahari forces are estimated at 75,000, mostly human, with some dwarven and elven troops, a few loyalist goblins, and harpy mercenaries. These forces are disorganized and unmotivated and are unlikely to offer serious resistance despite their numbers. Many goblins have defected following recent defeats and acts of collaboration.\n\nWe assess that total victory is very likely, especially if the local goblin population continues to cooperate. However, the sea-fortress of Odval Tungr is expected to provide heavy resistance and will likely require additional time to capture.\n\nSixty thousand of our troops have advanced into Bahar, forty thousand from Shazstundihr toward the city of Aqatbar and the hold of Odval Tungr, and twenty thousand from Orghelovar pushing into Ourdia. The eastern force split into two groups after meeting minimal resistance. One group bombarded and captured Aqatbar within three months, while the other faced stiffer resistance from human and dwarven forces in the western hills. This second group successfully secured the fortress of Bal Ouord and subsequently defeated the goblin and human armies in Ourdia.\n\nThe Second Artificer Corps performed exceptionally in maneuvering around and bombarding Bal Ouord with their magma cannons. I recommend they be awarded medals of honor for their skill. Local dwarven forces are offering significant resistance against the Fifth Infantry Regiment in the mountains surrounding Odval Tungr, due to strong fortifications and our current lack of artillery. The officers have requested a reinforcement of approximately 500 artillerists and 50 magma cannons, which I consider necessary for a swift advance.\n\nForces from Crathanor and Re-Uyel have reinforced Ourdian and goblin units. Field engineers have been ordered to divert streams of lava to disrupt them before they reach our positions. We have also received promised reinforcements: around 15,000 newly mobilized troops have arrived in Aqatbar, and a shipment of 75 magma cannons has reached Ourdia, which will be used to bombard and advance upon Crathanori positions. The generals express their gratitude to HQ for this support.\n\nAlong with this report, I have sent local battle reports from the generals detailing current forces, losses, and recent combat outcomes. The campaign is progressing smoothly, and we are steadily advancing. Attached is a map of the region showing territories under our control and areas still resisting.\n\nMarshal Gork Burnblood\nBahari Campaign, 1567"

AC5_fireplant_cash_crops_title: "Fireplant Cash Crops"
AC5_fireplant_cash_crops_desc: "We have made great advances in fireplant crops since we first created them. More variations have been invented, their production has been expanded, they grow quicker, and they have become increasingly delicious. Apart from ensuring a varied, healthy and delicious diet for ordinary kobolds and powerful generals alike, their production has been making us large amounts of money as we export and sell them.\n\nMany species of plants are called “Cash Crops” by the Cannorians - essentially plants which are highly sought after and mostly planted for cash. Variations of these are already being rapidly developed in our research facilities, and we will soon be able to produce, export and consume them. Goods which were once expensive and foreign, only enjoyed by the powerful, will become available and cheap to the regular kobold.\n\nEven better is that we will be making lots of money. We can dominate and control the markets for these plants - raising prices for everybody except the kobold, and using it to weaken our rivals and strengthen our economy."

#Column 2

AC5_settle_the_caverns_title: "Settle Down"
AC5_settle_the_caverns_desc: "Since the fall of Nimrith we have been surrounded by danger on all sides - made to run with our tails in between our legs, forced far from our home and our kobold kin. Just like in the rest of the Spine, we are under constant threat by goblin infested caverns and bands of black orcs fueled by chants lauding Dookanson. The same black orcs whisper of a monster they call the Trickster which leaves villages destroyed in its wake. All of these things we run from. Despite the woes of the Spine we have survived here as scavengers and explorers. After our long journey we have found a reason to stay - the hot, bubbling magma within the Molten Core.\n\nWe will not last long here if we cannot increase our power, and with a now scared and battered people there is a window of opportunity. We will use a small portion of the treasury we've built and the knowledge we've gained while exploring to seize power from the local chieftains. The more stubborn amongst them may still dissent, but any increase in our control of the region is a good thing."

AC5_uniting_caverns_title: "Unite the Clans"
AC5_uniting_caverns_desc: "Through blood and sweat we have taken the caves of the Buradforge and transformed them into something more. Once a temporary safe haven of scattered tribes, we have become one people under the Buruzagi.\nAlthough we have already convinced many chieftains to join our cause many have been unmoved by our bribery and silver tongues. They resist our authority, desperately clinging to the power they have left. Infuriating!\nNow that we have absorbed all of the kobold tribes we must rein them in. Unlike last time we will demand compliance! We will use our growing authority to crush the dissenters, leaving them as nothing but a footnote in the history of our nation."

AC5_kobold_lifestyle_title: "Magmascale Lifestyle"
AC5_kobold_lifestyle_desc: "Hundreds of children play in the lava pools while their parents are watching. Merchants negotiate the price of obsidian bricks in a stall made of the very same material. An old kobold works on an iron sword - to be gifted to the youngest kobold in the trivu on their 6th birthday, their coming of age. That child will later gift sparkdrive rifles to their own descendants.\n\nYounglings are having a competition about drinking the hottest molten rock, but the oldest have a big advantage - as the Magmascale children grow, their bodies learn to tolerate more heat due to both biological processes and training. This is considered a game for the poor - Officers and generals instead compete in hitting targets with lava cannons. The kobold who hits the most targets in an hour wins, but the game immediately ends on a perfect hit in the center.\n\nThe population and wealth of the Magmascale kobolds have greatly grown, fuelling these pursuits and hobbies. Schools and barracks are full as curious children learn to read and soldiers diligently train for upcoming wars, and the nation's coffers are filling with gold and metals. For the first time in hundreds of years the people of [Root.GetName] are learning to restrain and control their rage, and the nation no longer feels doomed after the catastrophes of decades past."

AC5_triggered_eruption_title: "Trigger the Eruption"
AC5_triggered_eruption_desc: "The ancient molten hold of Gor Burad hides something beneath its basalt surface. The workers cannot bear to be there, and they take shifts, to rest before the rage grows too strong to contain. Our people's sanity is not something to be sacrificed - but we are forced to in order to secure a future for our people.\n\nWhile the digging is painful, we are coming closer to our goal. The engineers estimate that we have arrived within ten meters of the lava, and even better - that a small eruption could begin soon. Thus the signal is given - Evacuate the workers and start using our stockpiles of explosives, in order to trigger the mountain's anger.\n\nOur plans are complete."

AC5_flood_serpentreach_title: "Flood the Serpentsreach"
AC5_flood_serpentreach_desc: "The Serpentsreach is ours! We have conquered the roads and holds and will now remake them in our image. Kobolds shall settle on the fertile spots of the roads, and in time we will have the caverns too. The roads will be purged of dwarves, and the Great Lava River will be extended to the holds of Orghelovar and Shazstundihr.\n\nThis conquest has not been easy, but Zutarzira is finally secure for the first time, and we shall make use of this peace. The engineers are ready to unleash a flow of lava upon the rest of the reach. However, this time it will already be under our control. We will build up and construct our nation around the river, and then we will be able to advance onto the surface.\n\nThe times of hardship and despair have ended, the path forward is no longer obscured by the fog of uncertainty. We know what we must do. Nimrith lights our way, and so will the Lava River."

AC5_leaking_out_title: "Leaking Out"
AC5_leaking_out_desc: "When we march upon Bulwar, it shall be a storm from both east and west, ensuring their decadent kingdoms shall fall in quick succession. We shall deal them a blow hard enough that it will take years to fully recover, and then march upon their territories. While several positions in Bahar are heavily fortified, the devastation of their lands will force them to surrender, as without food a fortification cannot survive, and without an economy a state cannot fund its army.\n\nWe have spent years amassing lava in the lower levels of Shazstundihr and Orghelovar. Now we shall unleash this lava upon the surface, devastating their lands and destroying their armies. Bahar shall fall. Zutarzira shall ascend."

AC5_flood_suran_title: "Flood the Suran"
AC5_flood_suran_desc: "Bulwar has fallen. Its centers of power lie in our hands and its people are subjugated. Our forces take residence in the palaces of the Sun Elves, trade at the markets in Brasan, marvel at the beauty of the Gardens of Bulwar, and some even pay visit to the Sun Temples to ask for the guidance of the Bulwari god, Zurakel.\n\nWhile these sites are surely great, we will build monuments that are greater. The old must be swept away to make space for the new. A torrent of lava will sweep Bulwar, and force it to follow our will.\n\nWe control the Suran River and can now shape it as we see fit - replacing it with a lava river. Bulwar, Sareyand, Brasan and Azka-Sur will become great lavacities, monuments to our might. Bulwar shall no longer the cradle of humanity. Instead, it will become our new heartland: A kobold heartland."

AC5_endless_lavacities_title: "Endless Lavacities"
AC5_endless_lavacities_desc: "The success of our first Lavacities has exceeded all expectations. These molten metropolises have become beacons of kobold civilization, centers of industry and culture that attract populations from across our realm. But why stop at just a few? The potential for expansion is limitless.\n\nOur engineers have perfected the art of Lavacity construction. We know how to channel lava flows to provide heat and power, how to design buildings that thrive in high temperatures, and how to create urban environments where kobolds, orcs, and goblins can work together productively. The infrastructure is proven, the techniques are refined, and the resources are available.\n\nWe shall build Lavacities along every major lava river, transforming our entire realm into a network of interconnected molten cities. Each one will be a testament to our ingenuity and a staging ground for further expansion. Let the world marvel at our endless Lavacities stretching from the depths of the Serpentspine to the distant shores of conquered lands."

AC5_settle_suran_title: "Settle the Suran"
AC5_settle_suran_desc: "With the raising of the Lavacities hastening the reconstruction of the Suran, many kobolds dream of the territory one day being our heartland. Indeed, it could very well become one – provided we establish the infrastructure and housing for our people to live there. The cities are already growing in prosperity, despite the long routes for proper Magmascale product to get there and – due to this, the high prices. Because of the Lava River Barges, we are still able to export out the mouth of the river, and industrialists and artificers alike have seen fit to establish new and advanced infrastructure and industry along it.\n\nWe must invest in this area. We have the resources and money, kobolds are flocking to the area, and it is the most beautiful and fertile land we have conquered. The Lavacities provide a great base for further economic expansion here, yet they are lacking in supplies and food. Establishing a stable farmland would lower their prices and give them more economic breathing room and would strengthen our control over the area."

AC5_pyramid_pyre_title: "Pyramid Pyre"
AC5_pyramid_pyre_desc: "The Khet have shown no respect for our people, and we carry no respect in return. Despite their descent into weakness, the remaining humans of Kheterata continue to zealously worship them, as is expected of such a backwards people. Due to this, rebellion has festered within their lands. While they are easily crushed, they also prove quite a significant nuisance, distracting our troops. The quick and simple solution is to cow them and the Khet through a show of strength, preferably a permanent one that will also facilitate further colonization of Kheterata by proper Zutarziran citizens - be that kobold, orc or else.\n\nThe engineers present their plans: the Zaranzutar. They request us to flood Elikhet’s Pyramid with lava, and turn it into a massive Lavaforge the likes of which the world has never seen. This would have great benefits for the state. First, we would curb the Khet and thus the Kheteratans by killing their chief god, which while it will not end their resistance it would be a crushing blow to their morale - and as it is already running low we can safely say many will lay down their arms.. Secondly, we would build up infrastructure for a further colonization of Kheterata - while the plans for a Lavaforge have been discussed, some engineers have presented plans to turn it into a transport and administrative hub for territories on the Burning Sorrow. The administration has given its go-ahead to all of these plans, and thus the construction of the Zaranzutar begins."

#Column 3

AC5_rock_smelteries_title: "Rock Smelteries"
AC5_rock_smelteries_desc: "We have begun to transform Buradforge into a thriving industrial center with support from Gor Burad. The ringing of picks against rock and hammers against iron sings out into the steamy hot air. All of it is fueled by the magma channels below.\nAs our molten rivers flow across more and more of the serpent spine, we yet again find ourselves low on magma. But we now have the industry; the forges, the canals, and workers all throughout. If we cannot retrieve enough lava from the Spine we will make more ourselves!\nThroughout our caves we begin constructing quarries which source great rock smelteries along the canals. The smelteries take in rocks from quarries, smash them and shovel the debris into large pools of lava. The then molten rock is released back into the channels for industrial use. Moltenbrand orcs are particularly in demand for this strenuous work. With their help, more lava than ever spills through our canals."

AC5_melting_walls_title: "Melt the Walls"
AC5_melting_walls_desc: "There was once a pale monster we knew as The Trickster. The orcs now tell us he named himself Orcrend as an insult against them, and that he belonged to a rare race of people called humans. Instead of living in caves humans live somewhere beyond, where there is bright light and no ceiling and the ground is green and soft like fur. This “surface” is where the orcs say Korgus took his men to fight.\n\nThese stories passed down from the orcs are strange to us, but orcs aren't ones to joke about topics as serious as Orcrend and Korgus. If this place does exist, we should access it and see if we can exploit it. While the Firebrand orcs don't remember the way out, maybe we can melt away enough rock to get there."

AC5_fill_valley_title: "Fill the Valley"
AC5_fill_valley_desc: "The surface world presents us with new challenges and opportunities. These vast valleys and lowlands, while foreign to our underground origins, offer excellent potential for our expansion if we can adapt them to our needs. The solution is obvious: we must remake the surface terrain to suit our people.\n\nOur engineers propose a massive undertaking - the systematic flooding of strategic valleys with controlled lava flows. This will create new settlements along molten rivers, establish supply lines between our underground strongholds and surface territories, and most importantly, terraform the land into an environment where kobolds can thrive.\n\nWhere once green fields and gentle streams offended our eyes with their alien softness, there will be rivers of orange fire and cities of obsidian and steel. The valleys we fill will become arteries of our empire, carrying the lifeblood of molten rock that powers our civilization."

AC5_emergency_flood_title: "Emergency Flood"
AC5_emergency_flood_desc: "War has come to our borders, and our enemies think they can exploit our still-developing surface infrastructure. They are wrong. While our traditional defensive positions in the caverns remain impregnable, we cannot allow hostile forces to establish themselves on the surface territories we have worked so hard to claim.\n\nFortunately, we have prepared for this moment. Our engineers have identified key chokepoints and strategic locations where emergency lava floods can be triggered at a moment's notice. These are not the carefully planned and controlled flows we use for terraforming - these are weapons of war, designed to wash away enemy armies in torrents of molten death.\n\nLet our enemies come. They will learn why the ancients feared the wrath of volcanoes, and why kobolds are the masters of fire itself. When the emergency floods are unleashed, their armies will be consumed, their siege equipment will melt, and their dreams of conquest will turn to ash."

AC5_burning_bulwar_title: "Burning Bulwar"
AC5_burning_bulwar_desc: "Bulwar, the ancient cradle of human civilization, now lies under our dominion. Yet its conquest is merely the beginning. To truly make these lands ours, we must transform them completely. The green fields that once fed human cities must give way to lava-fed industry. The gentle rivers that carried trade goods must be replaced with molten arteries that power our forges.\n\nThis is not mere destruction - this is transformation. We are not barbarians who simply burn and pillage. We are architects of a new world order, reshaping the very landscape to serve our vision of the future. Bulwar will become the greatest jewel in our empire, but it will be a jewel of obsidian and flame, not the soft materials preferred by weaker races.\n\nWhen the burning of Bulwar is complete, it will stand as proof that the age of human dominance is over. In its place rises the age of the kobold, the age of fire, the age of Zutarzira."

AC5_annihilate_khets_title: "Annihilate the Khet"
AC5_annihilate_khets_desc: "The Khet gods have ruled over Kheterata for millennia, demanding worship and tribute from their human subjects while offering little in return but empty promises and divine arrogance. These so-called deities are nothing more than parasites, feeding off the devotion of mortals while contributing nothing to the advancement of civilization.\n\nWe kobolds recognize no gods but Nimrith, and we bow to no divine authority save that which we forge with our own claws and ingenuity. The Khet represent everything we despise: stagnation, tradition for its own sake, and the elevation of the old over the new. They must be utterly destroyed if Kheterata is to have any hope of joining the modern world.\n\nOur campaign against the Khet will be comprehensive and merciless. We will tear down their temples, scatter their priests, and demonstrate to their worshippers that these 'gods' are powerless against kobold steel and fire. When the last Khet falls, Kheterata will be free to embrace progress under our enlightened rule."

AC5_ignite_sorrow_title: "Ignite the Sorrow"
AC5_ignite_sorrow_desc: "The Mother's Sorrow, that great river system that has defined the geography and politics of the known world for thousands of years, represents the final frontier of our expansion. Control of this waterway means control of trade, agriculture, and communication across vast stretches of territory. It is the ultimate prize.\n\nYet we are not content merely to control the Mother's Sorrow - we will remake it entirely. Our engineers have developed plans to ignite the entire river system, transforming it from a waterway into a molten highway that will serve our empire's needs. The technical challenges are immense, but so too are the rewards.\n\nWhen the Mother's Sorrow burns with our fire, every nation that depends on its waters will be forced to acknowledge our supremacy. Trade will flow only with our permission. Cities will prosper or wither at our whim. The ignition of the Sorrow will mark the moment when our empire truly becomes master of the known world."

AC5_flamewoven_threads_title: "Flamewoven Threads"
AC5_flamewoven_threads_desc: "Our expansion has created a vast empire spanning multiple continents, but distance and diverse terrain threaten to weaken the bonds that hold our realm together. We need more than just lava rivers to connect our territories - we need a comprehensive network of communication and transport that can function across any environment.\n\nThe solution lies in our latest artificery breakthrough: flamewoven threads. These are not mere communication lines, but magical conduits that can carry messages, small goods, and even energy across vast distances almost instantaneously. They are powered by the same volcanic forces that drive our civilization, making them completely integrated with our existing infrastructure.\n\nWith a network of flamewoven threads connecting every major settlement in our empire, we will achieve a level of coordination and control that no previous civilization has ever matched. Orders from the capital will reach the furthest frontiers in minutes rather than months. Our empire will function as a single, unified organism, with every part working in perfect harmony with the whole."

AC5_realm_forged_in_fire_title: "Realm forged by Fire"
AC5_realm_forged_in_fire_desc: "We have done it.\n\nThe Cannorians lie dead. Bulwar is subjugated. The grandest of all rivers, the Mother's Sorrow, is counted among our core territories.\n\nOur industry has risen to new heights. We are unrivaled on Halann. Our army cannot be beaten. No nation shall ever be our equal, not even an alliance of all humans, hobgoblins, elves and dwarves could ever even dream of matching it. The realm of Zutarzira, the lake of fire, is greater than we could ever have dreamed.\n\nWe have sacrificed much to get here. We have destroyed peoples. We have wiped empires off the map - in their place, our molten orange. Yet that is almost little when one considers what we have lost. Millions of lives, hundreds of thousands of names lost to history, fields and caverns full of gravestones. Our entire people have toiled and pained for hundreds of years, and we have endured a constant struggle to maintain our sanity in the face of pure rage. Yet we have risen so far, and stand so great, that we cannot keep from believing it was all worth it.\n\nPerhaps there is more to do - Cannor, though doomed, still must be finished off; new threats may emerge, in far Haless, and our economy can always grow. But those are for tomorrow, not today, for today is a day of rest. We rest knowing that Zutarzira is the greatest nation on Halann - for now, it is time to celebrate. Today, we celebrate the completion of Nimrith's great work; we celebrate that we are finally free - unthreatened by hostile powers; we celebrate the empire that we forged - never to fall."

#Column 4

AC5_exploit_fissures_title: "Exploit Fissures"
AC5_exploit_fissures_desc: "Gor Burad had long sat intermittently occupied by bands of orcs before we settled it.\nDwarven holds such as these are confusing to us - how could anyone live within these walls? Not many would be willing to leave our caves to come here if not for a good reason.\nLuckily for us the hold is built directly above a volcanic chamber which makes the hold's air hot and thick - great working conditions! We cannot rely on the lava in the molten core forever, so harnessing the magma in the hold is paramount.\nThe hold also contains a forge, centuries old and falling apart, yet fixable. It seems the dwarves funneled lava into the forge for metalwork and creating obsidian objects and art forms.\n\nIt will take quite a lot of digging to access the magma but afterwards we may be able to divert it for use in our caves."

AC5_funneled_lava_title: "Funneled Lava"
AC5_funneled_lava_desc: "After years of back breaking digging beneath Gor Burad the first kobold cracks through hot, red magma streams down Lavawater tunnel. Orcs and goblins celebrate alongside their Magmascale brethren as they happily take their pickaxes to less dangerous sites. The miners begin digging canals deep into the old dwarven roadway and through the rocky cave floor. The magma flows out and then through them, lighting our cave homes with a scarlet glow. We begin to forge our swords from the heat of the new lava, and roast our meats above it. If only we could coat our enemies in it…"

AC5_learning_from_strong_title: "Learning from the Strong"
AC5_learning_from_strong_desc: "If one looks through the history of our people, we have gone from defeat to defeat. First we fled by the thousands following the fall of Khugdihr. Following that, the ones who still believed in peace with the dwarves attempted to do so, and were massacred by dwarven hands. Following the massacres we fell into tribal conflict, fighting trivu against trivu to no avail. Our people are only unified due to another crisis - the Decimation of the 1430s, where the pale monster known as the Trickster killed, tortured and purged us during a period of mass goblin raids, leaving our people hopeless and weak.\n\nThe orcs survived all these catastrophes. If we are to do the same, we must learn from them. They value strength and prowess and reject the notion of hereditary rule, instead proving their legitimacy through battle. They value power over continuity, and accept change and new leaders. They have dominated the serpentspine and subjugated the other races countless times, so their advice will be of great use..."

AC5_rule_of_strength_title: "Rule of Strength"
AC5_rule_of_strength_desc: "“The tension is palpable across the Viraxia. It appears that protests have quieted down, which can only mean one thing: plotting. And the plotters are making themselves painfully obvious, yet there is little I can do. Manifestos have been published calling for a complete military takeover of the Magmascale Viraxia, and a statocracy to be formed around ideals of militarism and revanchism, ones we cannot afford to adopt. I have made efforts to weaken and contain their strength, but it has been too little too late - the military’s strength is what the monarch relies on in our Viraxia, and therefore I have been unable to make major strides in their containment.\n\nHow did this happen? Previous monarchs have been naive and foolish, and the army has thus been granted vast powers to shut down revolt, and gained popular support with it. They now deem themselves powerful enough to crush any opposition, and are bound to make their move on the state apparatus soon. And thus, the army will strengthen the powers of rage in our nation. I ask myself, what is the point in wars and victory if they will only serve to further the cycle of violence? We are meant to stand up for ourselves, not decimate other peoples in a quest for rule that will only bring yet more hate into our hearts. Yet the people do not seem to understand, and a monarch cannot rule without the assent of his supporters. So thus, the cycle of violence will continue, unbroken…”\n\n-Journals of the last Magmascale chieftain"

AC5_orcish_auxiliaries_title: "Orcish Auxiliaries"
AC5_orcish_auxiliaries_desc: "The Moltenbrand orcs are strong. Many of them serve in our military even now, and they have proven great soldiers. However, many among the Moltenbrands have not seen the benefits of the rise of Zutarzira; while our state has invested in them before, a large portion of the orcish population languishes in poverty. Some of them have offered us a solution to this problem: aid their people in migrating to the surface, where they can claim new lives.\n\nWe see no reason not to encourage this, as a local orcish population would suppress unrest in and around formerly human territories, contribute to the local economy and join the military and garrisons. In addition, they would help settle the lava rivers – immigration incentives for kobolds have been helpful, and the population is growing rapidly, but the rivers are still painfully underpopulated, leaving them a soft underbelly. We of Zutarzira are one people, and thusly we must make the population of the Lava River a multiracial effort - bring in the orcs, and grant them the same incentives provided to the Magmascales."

AC5_scorched_wings_desc: "The Harpy Hills lie broken before our might. Though the roosts remain untouched, the signs of our conquest are unmistakable. Our encampments sprawl out in the valleys, the heat from our forges permeates the air, and our cannons lie entrenched on the hills. While the threats on the surface are still many, the main threat are the dormant, complacent and unprepared Sun Elven kingdoms. They will fall in time.\n\nThese hills are a nice place - one could see why the harpies wished to roost here. The great magma ball called Zurakel provides us with ample light during the day, making it a more inviting place than our caverns. There is more food to be found, and the ever-threatening rage seems to weaken up here. Maybe it is this Zurakel's light that heals our hearts.\n\nThe harpies have claimed dominance over this land for millennia - but now their time in the light is over. Whether we accept them or not, this will be the last Harpy Queendom to fall, for there shall never rise another.\n\nThey are but the first - the entire continent will be ours"

AC5_first_lavacities_desc: "Our emergence onto the surface world has opened new possibilities for expansion, but it has also presented us with the challenge of adapting our underground civilization to the alien environment above. The surface dwellers build with wood and stone, materials that are weak and temporary. We will show them how proper cities should be constructed.\n\nOur first surface Lavacities will serve as beacons of kobold ingenuity and power. Unlike the primitive settlements of humans and elves, these cities will be built around controlled lava flows that provide heat, light, and industrial power. The buildings will be constructed of obsidian and heat-resistant metals, designed to last for millennia rather than mere centuries.\n\nThese cities will also serve as forward bases for our continued expansion across the surface world. From their volcanic forges will come the weapons and tools needed to conquer new territories. In their schools and workshops, the next generation of kobold engineers and warriors will be trained. The first surface Lavacities mark the beginning of a new age - the age of kobold dominance above ground."

AC5_engineers_of_war_title: "Scions of War"
AC5_engineers_of_war_desc: "War has always been the ultimate test of a civilization's capabilities, and our recent conflicts have proven that our military engineering corps is second to none. These elite kobolds, who we now honor with the title 'Scions of War,' have revolutionized the art of warfare through their innovative use of lava-based weaponry and volcanic engineering.\n\nThe Scions represent the perfect fusion of our traditional kobold ingenuity with the harsh lessons learned in battle. They are not merely soldiers, nor are they merely engineers - they are warrior-artificers who can design and build siege weapons in the field, redirect lava flows to break enemy fortifications, and create battlefield innovations that no enemy can anticipate or counter.\n\nUnder their leadership, our armies have become unstoppable forces of technological superiority. While our enemies rely on crude weapons of steel and wood, our Scions deploy magma cannons, lava-powered siege engines, and portable forges that can turn any battlefield into an extension of our industrial might. They are the vanguard of our empire's expansion and the guarantee of our continued military supremacy."

AC5_threaten_cannor_desc: "The Cannorian believes it is his right to both fear and look down upon us - he views us as uncivilized, but is horrified of us attacking his nation. His leaders desire to invade us, to destroy us, to massacre our people. They desire to retake Bulwar for the humans, to reclaim the cradle of humanity, but it is no longer the cradle of humanity - it is the new cradle of koboldkind! They are fools, for their war of liberation is too late. Instead of being greeted as liberators, their invading soldiers would see millions upon millions of brave Magmascale soldiers, ready to defend their homes.\n\nWe must strike first and end this threat from the west. The Cannorian realms shall stand no longer and be subsumed by a wall of fire! We will wage a war of destruction upon their puny realms, and once they are destroyed, Anbennar will be ours, their dreams of unity crushed. For the only thing they are united in is weakness."

AC5_fallen_empire_title: "Fallen Empire"
AC5_fallen_empire_desc: "The Empire of Anbennar, that ancient bastion of human civilization, lies broken before our might. Its proud cities smolder in the heat of our lava flows, its armies are scattered to the winds, and its people flee before the advance of our unstoppable legions. What was once the greatest power in the known world is now nothing more than a collection of burning ruins and traumatized survivors.\n\nThis victory represents more than mere military conquest - it is the symbolic end of the old world order and the beginning of our new age. For centuries, the Empire of Anbennar stood as the pinnacle of human achievement, the proof that their race could build something lasting and great. That proof has now been reduced to ash and molten stone.\n\nYet we are not mere destroyers. Where the old empire fell, we will build something greater. From the ashes of Anbennar will rise new Lavacities, populated by kobolds and allied races who understand the true meaning of progress. The fallen empire's legacy will be not its own achievements, but its role as the foundation upon which our greater civilization is built."

AC5_construct_lavaforges_title: "Construct Lavaforges"
AC5_construct_lavaforges_desc: "The success of our initial industrial expansion has created a demand for specialized facilities that can handle the most advanced aspects of our metallurgy and artificery. Standard forges, while adequate for basic production, cannot achieve the temperatures and precision required for our most ambitious projects. We need Lavaforges - industrial complexes that harness the raw power of molten rock itself.\n\nLavaforges represent the pinnacle of kobold engineering, combining our mastery of volcanic forces with our innovations in metallurgy and magical artificery. These facilities can produce materials and devices that would be impossible to create through conventional means. Flamemithril, heat-resistant alloys, and the most powerful magical items all require the extreme conditions that only Lavaforges can provide.\n\nThe construction of our first Lavaforges will mark our transition from a regional power to a true technological superpower. The weapons, tools, and materials produced in these facilities will give us advantages that no enemy can match or counter."

AC5_forge_every_home_title: "A Forge in every Home"
AC5_forge_every_home_desc: "The industrialization of our society has reached a point where every kobold family should have access to the tools and facilities they need to contribute to our civilization's advancement. Currently, industrial production is concentrated in large facilities, creating bottlenecks and limiting the creative potential of our people. We must decentralize and democratize our industrial capabilities.\n\nThe 'Forge in Every Home' initiative will provide every kobold household with a small but sophisticated forge powered by local lava flows or heated by flamemithril cores. These home forges will be connected to our larger industrial network, allowing families to take on specialized production contracts while also pursuing their own creative projects.\n\nThis program will not only increase our overall industrial capacity but also ensure that every kobold child grows up with hands-on experience in metallurgy and artificery. The next generation will be the most technically skilled in our history, capable of innovations we can barely imagine."

AC5_molten_artillery_title: "Molten Artillery"
AC5_molten_artillery_desc: "Our early experiments with magma cannons have proven the devastating effectiveness of lava-based artillery, but these weapons are still crude and limited in their applications. The time has come to develop a comprehensive doctrine of molten artillery that will revolutionize warfare and establish our absolute dominance on any battlefield.\n\nMolten artillery represents a completely new category of warfare that only kobolds can effectively deploy. Our weapons fire projectiles of contained lava that explode on impact, spreading molten death across enemy formations. Unlike conventional artillery, our weapons can reload by drawing directly from nearby lava flows, giving them effectively unlimited ammunition in the right terrain.\n\nThe psychological impact of molten artillery cannot be overstated. Enemy soldiers who witness their comrades consumed by liquid fire will break and flee rather than face such weapons. Fortifications that could withstand months of conventional siege will fall in days when subjected to the sustained heat of our molten bombardment."

AC5_flamemithril_formula_title: "Flamemithril Formula"
AC5_flamemithril_formula_desc: "Mithril, that precious metal coveted by dwarves and elves for its magical properties and incredible durability, has always been rare and difficult to work with using conventional techniques. However, our mastery of extreme temperatures and volcanic processes has revealed new possibilities for this remarkable material. We have discovered how to forge Flamemithril - mithril enhanced and transformed by exposure to the heart of our lava flows.\n\nFlamemithril possesses all the beneficial properties of standard mithril while gaining new characteristics that make it ideal for our civilization's needs. It conducts and channels heat rather than resisting it, making it perfect for constructing equipment that must operate in extreme temperatures. It also resonates with volcanic magic, amplifying the power of our artificery.\n\nThe perfection of the Flamemithril formula will give us access to materials that no other civilization can produce. Our weapons will be sharper, our armor lighter yet stronger, and our magical devices more powerful than anything our enemies can field."

AC5_lava_fueled_industrialization_desc: "Our piecemeal industrial development has served us well in the early stages of our expansion, but the time has come for a comprehensive industrialization program that will utilize the full potential of our volcanic resources. We must transform our entire economy to take advantage of the unlimited energy provided by our lava flows.\n\nLava-fueled industrialization will involve the construction of massive industrial complexes along our major molten rivers, each one capable of production levels that would require hundreds of conventional facilities to match. These complexes will be integrated systems where the waste heat from one process provides the energy for another, creating an efficient cycle of production that generates minimal waste.\n\nThis industrial revolution will not only increase our production capacity exponentially but also free our population from manual labor, allowing them to focus on more creative and intellectually demanding pursuits. Our society will become one where every kobold is an engineer, an artificer, or a scholar, supported by the tireless work of lava-powered machinery."

AC5_strenghten_engineers_title: "Elevate the Scions"
AC5_strenghten_engineers_desc: "Our engineering corps, the Scions of War, have proven themselves to be the most valuable asset of our expanding empire. These brilliant kobolds have revolutionized warfare, industry, and infrastructure through their innovative applications of volcanic engineering. However, their current status and resources do not reflect their crucial importance to our civilization's success.\n\nThe elevation of the Scions involves more than simply providing them with better equipment and higher pay, though both are certainly warranted. We must establish formal academies where the most promising young kobolds can be trained in the advanced arts of volcanic engineering. We must create research facilities where the Scions can push the boundaries of what is possible with lava-based technology.\n\nMost importantly, we must recognize the Scions as a distinct class within our society - not quite nobility in the traditional sense, but a technical aristocracy whose expertise and innovations drive our empire's continued expansion and development. Their elevation will ensure that kobold engineering remains the most advanced in the world."

AC5_artificer_lavaforges_title: "Artificer Lavaforges"
AC5_artificer_lavaforges_desc: "Our most skilled artificers have long been constrained by the limitations of conventional workshops and standard Lavaforges. While these facilities are adequate for mass production and routine manufacturing, they lack the precision and specialized capabilities required for the creation of truly exceptional magical items and advanced technological devices.\n\nArtificer Lavaforges represent the pinnacle of our technological and magical capabilities, facilities designed specifically for master craftsmen working on projects that push the boundaries of what is possible. These workshops will be equipped with the finest tools, the purest materials, and the most precisely controlled volcanic forces available to our civilization.\n\nIn these facilities, our greatest artificers will create the legendary items that will define our empire's legacy. Weapons that can channel the power of volcanoes, armor that makes the wearer immune to heat and flame, and magical devices that can reshape the very landscape according to our will. The Artificer Lavaforges will be the birthplace of wonders that will be remembered long after our empire has conquered the entire world."

flavor_magmascale.1.desc: "Erax was a builder. For a long time, Erax hated building. Erax loved the general idea of building something, but in practice it was boring, because he wasn't actually building most of the time. He did get paid, though. He “worked” 12 hours a day, four days a week, however his building materials would dry up early during the second day, so then he would just stand around doing nothing for the other half. Due to recent reforms in the Magmascale administration, the resource shortages had ended and now any worker would manage to get enough building materials for him to work with.\n\nNow, Erax loved building.\nThe projects he preferred the most were forges. The new industry was a joy to construct. Because the state had invested heavily in the forges, manufacturing was growing at a quick rate, and his profits with it - new facilities required builders, and as such there was an increasing demand for his services.\nErax wondered if he should get hirelings soon due to the rapidly decreasing deadlines on every project. Then he realized they were in short supply. Most younglings were going to the forges, which was probably the only downside of the new industry."

When Zira was a child, she was malnourished and poor, losing her father during the tumultuous tribal conflicts. Her fate would change during the start of the Magmascale ascension - she managed to enter the military academy and performed well, recieving high scores. From then on, Zira would always make sure to eat enough, and her allowance was enough so that she could afford some other wares as well.\n\nAs the children played in the lava pools, Zira wondered what a good childhood was really like. She was rather sure she wouldn't really understand, but her mind wandered. Not going without most of the time must be nice, she thought. She knew what that was like now - the academy provided plenty. However, there were still differences. Zira treasured every meal, but knew the children probably took it for granted. She envied them for that.\n\nThere were more children than there once was, they were happier and stronger. And they were the future. The future of the Magmascale people. Zira decided to walk over and play with them. She had a break, after all."

They are fools, for a divided house cannot stand. While the rise of a united Magmascale viraxia has mitigated this issue quite significantly, there has still been work to do. Until now. New policies have mandated that the Zendia will release their pent-up rage through competitions instead of warring, for example over such issues as who can provide the most disciplined soldiers. Combat tournaments are also now often arranged, which, while a remnant of the old institution of Zendia wars, continues to provide us with seasoned warriors, wasting fewer kobolds and interrupting or hurting less people, to the point that they are a positive. Lately, they have also provided an opportunity for enterprising kobolds to test their inventions' worth in battle.\n\nAs the state proves itself a skilled broker among the Zendia, trust and discipline in the populations and troops improves. However the main benefit is the cohesion and cooperation within the military being greatly improved, which while may prove a destabilizer also greatly increases its effectiveness. Watch these developments carefully, and the Magmascale nation shall grow."

However, a while has passed since then, and I have had the dubious opportunity of being captured again, this time through a devious trap involving one of those camouflaged lava-plants collapsing when I stepped on it and casting me into a pit.\n\nNow, our kobold enemies have once again clearly demonstrated their ingenuity and resourcefulness, not just in their trap-making, but in their aggrandizement of their capital. Indeed, a people once caught in a struggle for survival are now covering the upper levels of their home in a vast network of exotic gene-engineered plants. As I am allowed to return home, I cannot avoid thinking about what this place will come to look like in five decades or a century, if the Magmascale nation still stands.”\n\n-Diary of Brann Basalthammer, Farmer of Odval Lodhum"

The pain would have to be fought, at the same time as he fought the goblins.\n\nThis time, as all the others, there had been too many goblins to count. Every time he and his platoon finished reloading their massive lava cannon for another burst of molten rock, it had not arrived as a precise hit on a far-off enemy fortification. No, it was a desperate blow, doing little to stem the tide of goblins. The commanders - for there were no strategic targets to hit, simply the horde to contend with. And it was endless, and they were desperate. Zutarzira was desperate. It would do anything to end this crisis, and recover, and move outwards once again.\n\nIn the distance, he could count three portals, out of which flooded countless more goblins. Zarax decided to go for a walk in hopes of finding a medic or a lava stream that could cauterize his wound. He knew the engineers were amassing lava, so perhaps he could dip his damaged arm in it. Portions of it would also be used in a massive lava cannon, filled with three huge cannonballs that were made of pure lava contained by Flamemithril. Each of them would hit one portal, or so the rumors went. The timetable for the operation was set today.\n\nAfter a quick wait, Zarax was not disappointed.

flavor_magmascale.30.desc: "Arza looked down on the mines. They were deep - it was clear the rock had been carved, struck and bombed. Not long ago, the mines were full of activity - the sounds of digging, the creaking of lifts going up and down, laden with goods, and explosives permeated the rock. But now the engineers had declared that the lava would rise within a week, so the mines were emptied.\n\nIn the deepest, darkest portion of the caverns they had dug, Arza watched cracks form from the surface. Slowly they spread until they covered the floor of the mine. Then it began: Lava flowing through the holes that were forming; sheets of stone broken apart in the molten sea; the molten rock rising higher. Soon after this began, the crowds that had formed to watch the eruption started to dissipate. Arza stayed to watch a little longer, but as the lava approached he began to fear for his life and quickly left the mines.\n\nIn the coming days, the dwarves and goblins of the Serpentsreach would notice a molten glow in the distance. Many would ignore it, believing it was just a distant fight or a small stream - but they were soon crushed under the molten rock. Dwarven dreams of reclamation fell apart as remnant holds drowned in burning stone and adventurers on the roads were swept away by the molten tides - only those hiding in the caverns could survive.\n\nWhen the initial junction of the Great Lava River was complete in all its glory, it stretched from Gor Burad to Verkal Skomdihr to Hul-Jorkad. Out of all the peoples affected by this unprecedented ecological disaster, there was one victor - the Magmascale kobold. They could now set their plans to conquer and colonize the Serpentsreach into motion, due to having terraformed the land into one that suited them."

flavor_magmascale.33.desc: "Zurzix, the young general, stands in the throne room. He stands tall for a kobold, and you know his loyalty is only to Zutarzira itself, not to you.\n“The drums of war beat. Our people face looming threats in the north, south and west. We are only shielded by the eastern mountains. This situation cannot continue, and you have shown yourself incapable. The army implores you to stand aside so we can take power.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] answers:\n “Foolish child. A great general may rule a nation, but they will fail to govern it. If you had been wiser, you would see what my rule has accomplished: The caverns are secure, and we have taken Gor Burad. Our path has not faltered, and it will not.\nCease this foolishness immediately or I will personally see to your execution.”\n\nAnger enters Zurzix's expression.\n“You are fat, blind and weak. You care about nothing but your own power. You ignore what is best for our people, and focus only on yourself. Zutarzira will have proper rule. And I am not alone. The generals are in agreement; the people demand it. Only the old trivu will object, and they shall be swept away before our new order.”\n\nA guard walks into the room. He hands a sparkdrive rifle to Zurzix, who aims at the monarch - and hits.\nThe other generals enter the room, and see that the task is done.\n\nZurzix speaks:\n“Soon, the trivu will enter open revolt. We must sweep them away, and with them, the old guard. Nimrith has given us our tasks. Though treacherous, the path is clear. We must walk it or perish.”"
