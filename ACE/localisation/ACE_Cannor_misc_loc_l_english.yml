dragon_coast.1.t: "Choosing a Side"
dragon_coast.1.desc: "(Placeholder) The Dragon Coast has long been disputed territory: the Gnomes and the Kobolds each claim to have a historical claim to the entire area. What confuses the onlooker is why in fact they might be interested in the peninsula in the first place; after all, the Dragon Coast seems like some of the least arable, least valuable land in all of Cannor. But in truth, there is great potential hidden here... Potential that can be unlocked by either side of this debate, albeit in different ways. "

dragon_coast.1.b: "The Gnomes were here before anyone else, a thousand years ago!"
dragon_coast.1.c: "Mediate between the two sides"
dragon_coast.2.t: "Revitalising the Dragon Coast"
dragon_coast.2.desc: "The Dragon Coast is a region rife with potential. Even after the chaos of the Dragonwake heralded almost a millennium of strife between its various inhabitants, there is still a veritable bounty to be uncovered; from the fertile plains of the Dragondowns to the mineral-rich Dragonheights, one need only be willing to put in the effort to restore the land. We have resolved to provide that effort, now we must determine where to direct it."

dragon_coast.6.t: "An Offer of Cooperation"
dragon_coast.6.desc: "(Placeholder) With the successful conclusion of the Dragon Coast Revitalisation Project, and our own participation in the affair, we have been approached by some intrepid members of our chosen side. With the massively expanded infrastructure of the Dragon Coast, possibilities have opened up now which were not present before. They come with an offer: to become not just partners, but join administrations and allow them to serve in our government."
dragon_coast.6.a: "We accept their offer, and will adopt their administration."
dragon_coast.6.b: "We are glad to help, but will remain to govern ourselves."

ace_cannor_blast_furnaces: "Blast Furnaces of Aelhill"
desc_ace_cannor_blast_furnaces: "Aelhill is an ancient site indeed, having been first mined for its iron by the Sormanni kingdom before the Day of Ashen Skies. As one of the only sources of iron not under dwarven or Damerian (later Imperial) control in Lencenor, countless generations of Lencori have relied primarily upon the iron of Aelhill for their swords, spears and mail, as well as ploughs, sickles, scythes and other tools of civilization. Recent developments have led to the establishment of large blast furnaces of Ruby Dwarven design near Aelhill, which has brought about a new age of quality and quantity for good Lencori steel."
ace_cannor_mines_gulenhyl: "Mines of Gulenhyl"
desc_ace_cannor_mines_gulenhyl: "The Gulenhyl is the largest and oldest gold mine in Escann, its depths having been plumbed since the days of Castan Dwarf-friend. Indeed, the word 'Gulen' is a corruption of the dwarven 'Gulan', meaning gold, and dwarven miners have been delving into the Gulenhyl for hundreds of years. The Gulenhyl was also the site of the old Castanorian Mint which produced high-quality golden coinage for the Castanorians and their successor states such as Castellyr, and though the Greentide saw the destruction of Chivalric Escann, even the orcs have begun to mine the Gulenhyl once again for its gold, though perhaps for slightly different reasons."
ace_cannor_asra_bank: "Asra Bank Main Office"
desc_ace_cannor_asra_bank: "The Asra Bank was founded by Fognir Asra, patriarch of the ancient Clan Asra of the Agate Dwarves, after the conclusion of his First Expedition and reclamation of the Agate Gem from the ruins of Ovdal Asra. Since the Bank's foundation in Anbenncóst, it has rapidly become the foremost financial institution in Cannor, dealing with financial matters from Gerudia to Dostanor. Merchants and adventurers alike rely on the Bank to fund their expeditions, whilst many a Cannorian ruler has been backed, one way or another, by the Bank's bottomless vaults."
ace_cannor_hall_gallant: "Hall of the Gallant"
desc_ace_cannor_hall_gallant: "Every adventurer in Menibór, perhaps in all Cannor, hopes to be remembered in the hallowed Hall of the Gallant, a colossal memorial to those heroes who gave their lives in defence of glory, justice, and honour. With names and busts of famous adventurers dating back before even the Dragonwake, over a thousand years of adventuring history is catalogued within the Hall of the Gallant, and the Menibóri hope that it shall catalogue a thousand years more."
ace_cannor_floating_market: "Floating Market of Esmar"
desc_ace_cannor_floating_market: "Esmarainé is known as a market city and the heart of Esmaria, but the largest market within the city is not located on the river shores, but on the river itself, with the anabranches neighbouring the main channel of the Esmar playing host to a swarm of trader boats and barges, connected by a network of floating walkways."
ace_cannor_wightsgate: "Wightsgate"
desc_ace_cannor_wightsgate: "Wightsgate is a curious mix of fortress, tollgate, and roadhouse, controlling the main pass between the lowlands of the Alen and the Westmoors. Once the seat of House Wight before Lord Wight raised the dead of the mounds in defence of Toman the Mad, its origins are lost in time, but the smooth stone it is made of shows no sign of deterioration. Since the Gerwick Rising, the castle also contains a Neratic temple, with a sizeable contingent of priests patrolling the nearby burial mounds to prevent the dead from rising again."
ace_cannor_icewind_palace: "Icewind Palace of Commerce"
desc_ace_cannor_icewind_palace: "Since the foundation of the city of Celmaldor - Maldorian's Harbor in Elven - the noble family of the Icewinds have been integral to the city's development over the centuries. As a result of their copious wealth and prestige gained from their control over mercantile pursuits in the western Giant's Grave, the Icewind Palace of Commerce was constructed as a permanent edifice to the power and glory of the House of Icewind, and now provides the dual functionality of being home to the city's elected rulers, and also one of the most important trading centres in the city where hawkers, brokers and merchants from all over Gerudia and northern Cannor gather to do business, cut deals and make money. The business of Celmaldor has always been business."
ace_cannor_sorncell_shipyards: "Sorncell Shipyards"
desc_ace_cannor_sorncell_shipyards: "The deepwater harbor of Sorncell has been the site of a major port and shipyard since before even the time of the Damerian Republic, and is still in use to this day. Renowned for its ability to accommodate ships of all shapes and sizes, and well-protected by a natural spit of land that prevents storms from damaging the port infrastructure, the harbor is still the prime naval trading hub of the Borders, and the twin industries of shipbuilding and maintenance provide ample employment for the citizens of Sorncell. Consequently, Sorncell remains an extremely important city for anyone wishing to project power - either military or mercantile - into the northern Divenhal."
ace_cannor_ashfields_fertile: "Grey Wheat of Ashfield"
ace_cannor_ashfields_fertile_desc: "During the Day of Ashen Skies the Havoral Mountain erupted and spewed ash across the modern-day Borders and consequently covered what is known as Ashfield in ash. Shortly after this event a strange phenomena occurred in the surrounding area, where crops would grow at an increased rate - most notably the wheat. This Ashwheat soon became infamous not only for its grey-ish colour and distinctly bitter taste, but its filling nature that is heavy on the stomach."
ace_cannor_puckmuth_fortress: "Fortress of Puckmuth"
ace_cannor_puckmuth_fortress_desc: "Where the Dostanesck and the Varinn meet, the impressive fortress of Puckmuth stands. The hill on which it is located is lined with ancient, crumbling stones rumored to stretch back to the depths of time, to fortifications that stood well before even the Castanite Exodus.\n\nThe latest fortress on the site was built following the establishment of the modern state of the Brinkmarches during the Aldresian Crusade, but even it remains influenced by our unique regional style. The unseen, puzzle-piece protrusions that intricately weave the stones of our walls into unyielding patterns make our fortifications especially resilient to spells, cannons, and any other trouble that would come up against them. While some may call it inefficient and overly complicated, the quiet and simple lives of the Brinkmarchers hardly leave us wanting for time to shape them."

form_rohibonia_title: "Form Rohibonia"
form_rohibonia_desc: "The Lands we inhabit were once roamed by the Rohibonic tribes, migratory peoples who had an affinity to tame horses. Some of us even descend from these tribes. It's time to look back to our roots and revive the proud Rohibonic heritage."

ace_misc.1.a: "Yes"
ace_misc.1.b: "No"
ace_misc.1.a.tt: "§YWe will revive the Rohibonic culture§!.\n\n§G§YCrownsmen§! and §YArbarani§! cultures will be swaped over to the §YRohibonic§! culture group§!."
