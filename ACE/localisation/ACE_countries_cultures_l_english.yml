A48_veterans_of_the_long_war: "Veterans of the Long War"
A48_veterans_of_the_long_war_desc: "Ask a scholar, and they will inform you that the Long War against the Lich-King of Milcorissia ended nearly a millennium ago. Ask a Sugambrian, and they will tell you the truth - the Long War never truly ended. The undead still stalk the labyrinths underneath the Borders, not to mention the other dangers that crowd the region - gnollish raiders from the Khenak Mountains, or the pirates of the Divenhal who raid the coast, carrying their plunder back to the Shadow City or gnollish jetties.\n\nIn the face of all these threats, Sugamber persists, their people facing evil down as their ancestors did. And so the Long War continues."
A48_rhinns_mound: "The City of Rhinn’s Mound"
A48_rhinns_mound_desc: "Founded by Rhinn the Progenitor during the First Wexonard Kingdom, Rhinn’s Mound (nowadays shortened to Rhinmond) is the seat of the Dukes of Sugamber and the Duchy’s finest and largest city. This is due to its strategic position, marking the halfway point along the River Deed’s course to Busilar and thus a popular stopping point for merchants of both Busilar and the Borders.\n\nIt is not only merchants who travel through Rhinmond, though, as the city is also a hotspot of adventurers looking to cut their teeth or make some coin. This is due to what lies underneath the city - a Milcori Labyrinth, a ruin of ancient history that seems to change and shift even as it is explored. The drive to perennially clear undead before they leave the labyrinth and threaten the city produces a constant stream of posted quests, and the promise of treasure from old Milcorissia on such excursions, means that one cannot walk far in Rhinmond without seeing a party of adventurers looking to make it big from what awaits them below."
A48_lockcastle_fair: "Lockcastle Fair"
A48_lockcastle_fair_desc: "Are you going to Lockcastle Fair?\n\nNot only the opening line of a popular Wexonard folk song, it is also the first question posed to any traveler passing through its lands. People from across the Borders and beyond flock to Lockcastle for the festivities, which take place for the whole month of Suren to mark the beginning of Summer. At the fair, a visitor can enjoy browsing the grand market, perhaps buying some Arannese silks or a pair of fine Sugambrian shoes. They can then join the practically constant feast, sitting down for a hot Lockcastle stewed steak pie and a tankard of Bardswood. Then, in the evening, one can head to the wooden theatres made specially for the fair and enjoy a play. This is usually a rendition of the most popular tale in Sugamber, ‘The Lichbane’.\n\nWhile originally organized by the burghers of Lockcastle, the dukes of Sugamber have seen it as wise to give the Fair their official patronage. Having such a universally beloved festival done in the name of the duke does much to win over the common folk, and ensure that they continue to support the ruler of Sugamber."
A48_legacy_of_the_lichbane: "Legacy of the Lichbane"
A48_legacy_of_the_lichbane_desc: "King Rhinn II, more famously known as Rhinn Lichbane or Rhinn the Hammer, was, alongside his father Rhinn the Rider, one of the most celebrated Sugambrian kings of Wex. He earned his two nicknames during the Long War, where he led the Wexonards’ efforts against Xamarzu the Lich-King, his undead hordes and the Milcori armies who were loyal to him. Famous for his shock cavalry tactics, Rhinn led his men in sweeping maneuvers to disrupt the laborious movements of the ranks of undead, which created openings to strike at the necromancers serving Xamarzu;  thus he won battles without providing the Milcori with more bodies to turn against him.\n\nSuch movements required strict discipline from Rhinn and his chosen men, and provided them ultimate victory against the Lich-King. Our cavalrymen today often swear by their example, reading the legends about the Long War and hoping to follow Rhinn Lichbane’s example."
A48_order_of_the_roadwardens: "The Order of the Roadwardens"
A48_order_of_the_roadwardens_desc: "Founded in 1578, the members of the Order of the Roadwardens travel along the many roads that crisscross the duchy, patrolling them to keep them clear of the many threats that plague the Borders. On horseback, clad in light armour and wielding both pistol and sword, they often accompany travelers and merchants to keep them safe and earn themselves a bit of extra money in the process.\n\nThey also serve as a powerful force to call on during times of war, forming regiments known as ‘Outriders’ due to their role as skirmishers and scouts. They move ahead of the main force as reconnaissance, often using their knowledge of the terrain of the Borders to their advantage. Once in battle, they harass enemy formations with pistol shot, thinning their ranks and diverting attention from the main Sugambrian force."
A48_settlement_of_the_borders: "Settling of the Borders"
A48_settlement_of_the_borders_desc: "The Wexonard people were not the first to live in the Borders. We arrived here after the Dragonwake, fleeing from the dragons’ destruction to come to this land, which at the time was inhabited by the Milcori. They followed their Lich-King, and as such our ancestors were compelled to drive them out to make our own land, and to defeat their undead masters. As we drove the Milcori out of their homes and labyrinths with fire and sword, their former land became open for Wexonard settlements. \n\nAs such, we are no strangers to moving other people out of their lands to settle our own, and if the duchy ever requires an expansion of our Wexonard population in new territory, we need only crack open our history books and ancient tales to learn how to do so effectively."
A48_amber_aristocracy: "The Amber Aristocracy"
A48_amber_aristocracy_desc: "After the defeat of Xamarzu in 549, his hoard of treasures was looted by the victorious Wexonards. Amongst it was found a true treasure - a massive stone of amber, dug from the foothills of the Khenak. When it was transported back to Rhinn II, he decreed that it be cut into pieces by the craftsmen of Rhinn’s Mound and placed as the centerpiece of the floor of his new castle hall atop the Mound. The hall was thereafter referred to as the Amber Hall, and has been further embellished with amber ceiling inlays . The light bouncing off of the sparkling gems serves as an impressive display to all who visit.\n\nSaid visitors are overwhelmingly the aristocracy of Sugamber, and the hall serves as a place for them to speak to the duke and talk amongst themselves. This has earned the Sugambrian nobility the name ‘Amber Aristocracy’, a name they wear with pride, as even the nobles of Wexkeep envy the glamour of their Amber Hall."

The legacy of Lothane, the great conqueror, still echoes through the ages—his vision was clear: Wex would rule over all, unchallenged and supreme. It was Lothane’s ambition that set the course for our people, laying the foundation for the empire we are destined to build.

AC0_iorielist_diplomacy: "Iorielist_diplomacy"
AC0_iorielist_diplomacy_desc: "Lorent and Wex, both surrounded by hostile forces, found themselves sharing common enemies in Dameria and Gawed, two powers that sought to undermine their influence in the region. To gain the upper hand, Lorent and Wex employed underhanded tactics, using cunning and subterfuge to weaken these formidable adversaries. Through their strategic maneuvering, they played a crucial role in shattering Dameria, leaving it in ruins. Now, with Dameria fractured and defeated, the time has come to turn their attention to Gawed. Its downfall is inevitable, and Dau Croen will see to it that Gawed meets the same fate, solidifying their dominance in the region."

AC0_wexonard_school_of_fencing_desc: "The Wexonard School of Fencing is renowned as the greatest in all of Cannor, a prestigious institution where the art of the sword is perfected. Swordsmen from Dau Croen journey to Wexkeep, drawn by the school’s unmatched reputation, to master the techniques that have made its name legendary.

AC0_emulants_of_lorenan_desc: "Lorenan was a legendary conqueror who, through his strength and vision, united the fractured lands of Lencenor into a powerful and cohesive realm. His legacy is one of unmatched ambition and unyielding determination. We must now follow in his footsteps, emulating his great conquests to bring all the lands of Cannor under our rule.

They claimed to be fellow worshippers of Nimrith but were quickly turned by the Regent Court, and turned against us during the siege, which we shall never forgive nor forget. And not only they have done crime. The surface humans forced us into isolation for centuries, and then assisted the dwarves in invading us. We will forever remember. We shall ensure that they will never know peace again - Nimrith’s vengeful spirit shall forever haunt them, for we have not forgotten their past! Their spinelessness shall be their end!\n\nThe cruel dwarves attacked and killed us during the fall of Khugdihr. They murdered our people in cold blood, forced us to leave our homes and then their kin rejected us. They have shown time and time again that they will never accept us, and that we cannot coexist. We will forever remember. We shall ensure that they will never know peace again - Nimrith’s vengeful spirit shall forever haunt them, for we have not forgotten their past! Their obstinacy shall be their end!\n\nThe arrogant elves lurk on the surface, corrupting the humans with idiotic ideals of “peace” and “harmony”. They shall certainly not be spared either, for they incited the humans to attack us. The hypocrisy of supporting peace and harmony yet inciting attack! We will forever remember their transgressions. We shall ensure that they will never know peace again - Nimrith’s vengeful spirit shall forever haunt them, for we have not forgotten their past! Their arrogance shall be their end!"
AC5_heated_home: "A Heated Home"
AC5_heated_home_desc: "The Magmascale Kobolds spent most of their history being threatened by their enemies, whether among themselves or from the outside. Due to this, the kobolds were innovators in fortification and defense."
AC5_industrial_lavaforge: "Industrial Lavaforges"
AC5_industrial_lavaforge_desc: "The key reason the Zutarziran state held out for so long against hostile forces from all sides was its industrial capacity. The Magmascale Kobolds had constructed huge forges using lava as fuel, making them the strongest industrial power in the Serpentsreach. This advantage was further strengthened by their large population and well-defended urban centers.\n\nThe weapons and construction industries in Zutarzira were flourishing, granting economic security to the state and allowing the kobolds to properly hold their ground – their enemies would often be astounded at the quality of the Zutarziran army’s equipment. In times of peace, metal and obsidian-crafted exports allowed them to achieve relative prosperity, and during war, the Lavaforges ensured Zutarzira’s war machine would always keep more momentum than their enemies."
AC5_giant_anger: "The Cycle of Violence"
AC5_giant_anger_desc: "“Then they came. And there was so many of them, and their faces were so contorted with rage and hate. I didn’t understand why, though I would soon realize. I loaded my crossbow and shot one, who fell to the ground. Five more came, not looking back at their fallen friend. I shot another. They still didn’t look back. The instructors had promised us that the kobolds were cowardly and weak, but these weren’t. It was as if they were powered by some supernatural rage, something beyond my understanding. At some point they outran me, pushed me down while glaring and dragged me along with them after putting me in chains. After a while they began to appear calmer, but this was a facade: Once every few minutes or so their faces would flare up with rage and they would hit me. I recall at one point during the journey I tried to speak to them, but they hit me on the mouth until I was temporarily rendered mute.\nI believe this speaks volumes about the nature of our enemies. They must be exterminated and purged before they can harm another soul, for they have turned completely to madness.”\n\n-Writings of a Garnet officer"

AC5_firegrown_plants_desc: "The dwarves of Aul-Dwarov were fed by the farms of Tuwad-Dhumankon in addition to the Serpentsvale, while the Goblins and Orcs were fed by mushrooms and the various monsters they killed. However, this model of food production couldn’t work for Zutarzira due to their fiery environment, which meant that during times of war they experienced repeated famines and in times of peace they were hopelessly reliant on Bulwari and neutral remnant holds. Thusly, their scientists extensively experimented with bio-modifying plants to their benefit, in hopes of creating a stable food supply.\n\nHeat-resistant plants were created, and although these could be extensively grown, they lacked the nutrition of the other Serpentspine plants, rendering them essentially unusable. Therefore, the Zutarziran artificers experimented further. Eventually they got some plants to take in energy from heat, converting it to create nutrition. These plants could be reliably used to feed the large kobold population, and as such quickly spread throughout the Zutarziran domain. As a large variety of plants were modified to suit the Magmascale needs, Zutarzira could now maintain impressively high levels of food production and food security, despite having a large population in a hostile environment."

Through sheer force of will and unrivaled prowess, he has achieved what many thought impossible: uniting the fractured tribes of the Flamemarked swamps under his singular rule.\n\nHis vision is as bold as it is terrifying.

AC7_scavenging_lifestyle_desc: "The survival of the Flamemarked Gnolls in the unforgiving swamps of Daravan's Folly hinges on their relentless resourcefulness and savagery. In this inhospitable land, they scour the ruins of a forgotten kingdom, scavenging anything of value—ancient tools, rusted weapons, and scraps of armor—to sustain their brutal way of life.\n\nYet scavenging alone is not enough. The gnolls lie in wait amidst the tangled foliage and murky waters, ready to pounce upon any unfortunate adventurers or wanderers who stray too far into the swamp. These ill-fated souls become both sustenance and spoils for the Flamemarked, their belongings repurposed, and their flesh often sacrificed to feed the ever-burning fires of the Xhazobkult."

What others see as an unlivable quagmire, we see as our dominion—a place where the land itself bends to our will.\n\nWe have adapted to the harsh environment in ways that no outsider could comprehend. The treacherous waters, the dense fog, and the hidden dangers are our allies, not our obstacles. We know every twisting path, every shadowed grove, and every hidden refuge within the swamp."

AC7_scarred_flesh_desc: "The Flamemarked Gnolls carry their devotion to the Xhazobkult and their brutal traditions on their very skin, engaging in ritual scarification through demonflame. These searing rites etch intricate patterns into their hides, each mark telling a story of pack affiliation, personal achievements, and unwavering allegiance to their dark faith.\n\nWhile their overall structure retains echoes of their Sandfang ancestry, the Flamemarked Gnolls are among the most peculiar of their kind. Their appearance is further set apart by a unique and unsettling adaptation: the removal of their fur. Living in the parasite-infested swamps of Daravan's Folly, they have adopted the harsh practice of using caustic unguents to strip their hides bare."

AD5_the_five_fyrstyrimenn_families_desc: "You cannot function in Hallfreder society without having extensive knowledge on the five Fyrstýrimenn families, who are the direct descendants of the five captains that partook in the Expedition that started it all. They serve the rulers (and themselves) through a complex list of responsibilities and privileges. These families blend the lines between advisors, nobility, magnates and pretenders, and due to the long history of political intrigue and bickering, combined with an insular society, have managed to hold onto their archaic rights. Foreign visitors tend to get arrested  within a day for some seemingly innocent transgression unless accompanied by a Hallfreder guide. These five families have tremendous sway in politics, business and culture. They wield numerous privileges enshrined in ancient documents, some trivial and some of tremendous value. A crucial part of privileges are on tax exemptions that give certain families an edge in some industries, with in particular the Divenscourges having over 12 pages dedicated to theirs. Many businessmen seek out these exemptions, such as by asking for the hand of a Fyrstýrimenn daughter and trying to transfer their business to a newborn child with such rights. The list of rules is seemingly endless: The Skalir have the right to trade with incoming merchants before others. When a Vidarfótar bids on a slave, no commoner may outbid them. Before a Hallfreder may set foot on an island, he has to ensure a Divenscourger has set foot on it and named it first. Runestones may only be carved by Svartskeggs and spellcasting requires a license to be given by their patriarch. The Pearlsguards have right of interruption in the Thing. You may never look a Divenscourge in the eyes unless spoken to. Buying property on Rótargata street requires Pearlsguards permission. Do not yell near the Divenscourges mansion..."

Most Hallfreder commoners in Hallfredhavn and indeed all of the Brendrótaland lived in homes carved out of the dead and burned gigantic roots of the Kykrskógr (Effelai in the Common Tongue) that can be found all over this arid land. Through the centuries these dwellings have gotten more and more complex, as carvers turned roots into apartment complexes featuring stairs, windows and doors. They also carve tunnels straight through to allow passage past roots that stay on the surface for an otherwise annoying amount of length. Some Roots stay on the surface for such a long stretch that roads have been carved onto them, turning an otherwise dangerous stretch of nature safe with an elevated road.\nWhen Hallfreder trade with foreign realms intensified, selling burned root planks became one of the main exports of the region."

No spy is fluent in Gerudian or Common without an accent, and not to mention all our customs that are completely alien to the Langeyru. This feeling of loneliness may demoralise weaker peoples, but for the Hallfreders, it has only emboldened their fighting spirits."
AD5_the_frozen_city: "The Frozen City"
AD5_the_frozen_city_desc: "Hallfredhavn is often nicknamed The Frozen City by Cannorian historians, as its people stagnated technologically for several centuries, and in some regards even regressed. Between 904 AA and the early fifteenth century, no noteworthy inventions were made or diffused by Hallfreders, with the arguable exceptions of some woodcarving methods. (As brought up by Hallfreder patriots.) The Sidrvetr, which translates as Long Winter is a name often used to describe this lenghty period of national stagnation. Sidrvetr Hallfredhavn as described by runestones, books and poems is often studied to gleam insights into ancient Gerudian traditions, as it functions as a window into the past. Six centuries of infighting, suffering and political upheavals may have felt like a dark age to the Hallfreders, but to many outsiders their history is romanticized."

AD7_divenscourge_legacy_desc: "The Divenscourges are the greatest raiders to have ever roamed the seas, and Hallfred was no exception. He assembled the expedition fleet from the Reavers of the Divenhal, and as such every single inhabitant of [AD5.GetUsableName] is the direct descendant of a Reaver that once instilled fear into that far sea."
AD7_leiguthrael_system: "Armringrskipan"
AD7_leiguthrael_system_desc: "The Armringrskipan, meaning Armring System is an institution utilised by the [AD7.GetUsableName] Empire to administer subjugated realms and formalise subject-overlord relations. Upon subjugation the rulers are forced to wear an arm ring and swear oaths of loyalty to [AD7.GetUsableName]. The type of Armring that is given indicates the standing of the subject; A Damestear or Relic ring indicates special privileges and good standing. Conversely a subject that has evoked the ire of the administration might find themselves receiving a mere bronze armring. \nThis system developed into its current form after the conquest of Jötunnborg and the subsequent subjugation of neighboring Skegglander realms called for an effective decentralised system that wouldn't strain the administration too much."
AD7_burners_of_the_effelai: "Burners of the Kykrskógr"
AD7_burners_of_the_effelai_desc: "When the Fyrstýrimenn rested with the Parura in the swamps in the north, we learned how to placate Kykrskógr, the living forest. But when we subjugated the Oono'i, we learned how to burn it. The Tswohvwoh'ii, as they call it, is a living forest to the north of Hallfredhavn, which fights back if you try to cut or burn its wood. The Oono'i claim to have waged hundreds of battles against the thralls of this living forest, and have lost most of their population in the war to burn it as far as they have, but we are built different, we will not lose to some pesky trees. We will carry on their legacy."
AD7_survivors_of_the_slow_death: "Survivors of the Sidrvetr"
AD7_survivors_of_the_slow_death_desc: "The Sidrvetr, which translates as Long Winter is a lenghty period of national stagnation experienced by the Hallfreders. Its exact start and end date are hard to pinpoint, but the problems started compounding around 1120, not long after the Thing was formed. Radical reforms in 15th century eventually led to a reawakening, or a 'long summer' if you will. \nThe fact that the Hallfreders survived these terrible times is a testament to their willpower, and they have come out of it stronger than ever, ready to catch up for all the wasted centuries."
AD7_sailors_of_the_radiant_sea: "Sailors of the Radiant Sea"
AD7_sailors_of_the_radiant_sea_desc: "There was a time that but a single Hallfreder ship sailed the Radiant Sea, but still every Hallfreder considered themselves a sailor, as people squabbled over the right to sail on the Stadfastr, and many would gather at the harbor whenever it came and went. That time is beyond us, and our people dominate the seas once more: Traders ferry goods between Brendrótaland, the Skegglands and even Blámannaland, Reavers set out for rich shores and expeditions are organized to settle new lands and honor Hallfred. Not to mention the navy that guards our possessions with an awe inspiring fleet."
AD7_storsetning: "The Stórsetning"
AD7_storsetning_desc: "The Stórsetning, meaning great settling, is the multi-generational effort of confiscating valuable lands from the Langeyru and selling it to Hallfreder settlers. These settlements started being founded as early as the first forays into the Kalavend region, where the fertile Jötundalr valley was particularly popular. In later decades, after reconnecting with Cannor, this phenomenon took on a new form, where Gerudian, Pearlsedger and Reverian settlers from Cannor bolstered the number of settlers hundredfold."
AD7_cannorian_tourism: "Cannorian Tourism"
AD7_cannorian_tourism_desc: "Now that our Cannorian brothers have finally discovered that which we discovered centuries ago, they have started to visit us. Advertisements speak of [AD5.GetUsableName] as a tourist destination: 'Discover Gerudia as it was centuries ago', 'Step through a time portal to 9th century Pearlsedge' 'Walk among a thousand Runestones'. Whilst some tourists litter our streets with trash and mock our traditions, the stimulus into the local economies and our increased prestige on the world stage are most welcome."

Renowned for their mastery of horseback riding and their legendary abilities to tame and train even the wildest of steeds, they were a force to be reckoned with on the open plains. However, as time passed, the Rohibonic tribes faced fragmentation and decline. Choosing to adopt neighbouring cultures insteand, causing their Rohibonic cultural identity to fade."

A formidable warrior and a wise leader, Ara guided her people through tumultuous times and led them to the bountiful lands now known as the Damescrown Coast. This coastal region, blessed with natural beauty and abundant resources, became the new home for the Arami under Ara's leadership. Her most remarkable discovery was the rich veins of gold hidden beneath the earth, transforming the area into one of the wealthiest regions in Cannor."
AD2_ancient_bufferzone: "Ancient Buffer Zone"
AD2_ancient_bufferzone_desc: "The vast plains we inhabit have long served as a battleground, a buffer zone caught between the warring empires of the north and the south. Countless battles have been fought, and rivers of blood have soaked our soil. Yet, in this crucible of conflict, we have forged resilience and wisdom. We have learned not only to survive but to thrive, turning our hardships into strength and our plains into a homeland of enduring pride and prosperity."
AD2_lady_luck_spear: "The Rohibonic Cult"
AD2_lady_luck_spear_desc: "The Rohibonic tribes have long held deep reverence for the Arami Goddess Ara and her husband, Adean, the God of Horsemanship and Chivalry. This devotion gave rise to a distinct branch of faith diverging from the Regent Court, known as the Rohibonic Cult. Rooted in unique traditions and rituals, this religion places special focus on Ara, the Goddess of Luck, as a symbol of fortune and providence, and Adean, the embodiment of chivalry, honor, and bravery. Together, they represent the values that have guided the Rohibonic people for generations, shaping their way of life and their spiritual identity."
AD2_great_migrations: "The Great Migrations"
AD2_great_migrations_desc: "Our nomadic traditions trace their origins to the tumultuous era of the Dragonwake, when the chaos wrought by dragons displaced our ancestors, driving them from their homes. This way of life was cemented once more during the rise of the great Gawedi conqueror, Godrac, whose conquests forced us to abandon our lands yet again. Some of our ancestors fled eastward, where they endured enslavement under the centaur warlords of old. Through these trials, our nomadic lifestyle became ingrained in our culture, a symbol of resilience and adaptability. Now, we thrive in the vast open plains of the Alenic Frontier and Escann, turning hardship into strength and the open horizon into our home."
AD2_influenced: "Under Foreign Influence"
AD2_influenced_desc: "Positioned at the crossroads of Cannor, our lands have absorbed the influence of many cultures, primarily Alenic, Castanorian, and Damerian. This convergence has brought a blend of ideas and traditions, enriching our heritage in many ways. However, it has not been without consequence. The repeated conquests of our plains by foreign powers have often led to the erosion of our own cultural identity, as our people adopted the customs of their rulers and gradually abandoned the traditions that once defined us."
AD2_rohibonian_revival: "Rohibonic Revival"
AD2_rohibonian_revival_desc: "The Rohibonic culture, long thought consigned to the annals of history, has seen a resurgence with the awakening of pride in the Alenic Frontier. As neighboring cultures embrace their descent from the tribes and honor the legendary Rohibonic horsemanship, a revival of our ancestral traditions is underway. With the formation of Rohibonia and our claim to the legacy of these proud tribes, we stand at the forefront of this cultural renaissance.\n\nWe will champion the return of Rohibonic customs and traditions, rekindling the spirit that once defined our people. The Rohibonic tribes will ride again, their banners flying high as the plains of the Alenic Frontier resound with the thunder of hooves and the songs of our ancestors. This is our legacy—one we shall restore with honor and pride."

AD6_legacy_defenders_desc: "The constituent kingdoms of the Vivin Empire share in a history of constant warfare and have long carried the burden of defending every inch of land from ravenous and crafty enemies, be they Milcori, Gnolls or recently Orcs and Goblins. Through the ownership 3 Balgaric wonders as well as Aelcandar and countless Roilsardi and Aldresian crusader forts, the people of the Vivin empire are incredibly knowledgeable in the art of building, defending and maintaining fortifications."
AD6_black_thorns: "The Black Thorns"
AD6_black_thorns_desc: "The Order of the Black Thorns is a chivalric order that traces its ancestry back to the Aldresian Crusade. It was the spear-tip of the crusade into the dark heart of Corvuria, which eventually lanced the pustule that caused the pestilence. For this reason, their leader, Lucian síl Vivin, was granted the title of Protector by Jaher, and though he would ultimately disappear, his family and his order would live on, and the Corvurian kings still count the Grand Master of The Black Thorns amongst their titles. Most modern nobles of Corvuria are either a part of or at least had an ancestor who was part of the Order.\n\nThe Order of the Black Thorns is known openly for three things: their steadfast, if unorthodox, devotion to Nerat, their brutal and effective skills in war, and their unquestioning loyalty to the síl Vivin kings. Whenever Corvuria is threatened, whether by horrific monsters, terrible undead, or a simple recalcitrant peasant, the Order responds in the same manner: ‘Obliterate, with extreme prejudice.’ Many villages have been left burned to the ground in the wake of a Black Thorn Tribunal, and as such, peasants are quick to denounce their rebellious fellows to prevent their village from becoming the site of the next tribunal. "
AD6_direct_land: "Directed Land Use"
AD6_direct_land_desc: "For centuries, the poor lands of Corvuria have been plowed and tilted by equally poor peasants, feeding cities and nobles that were too wary of relying on foreign imports.\nNow that the Borders and Dostanor stand united under one crown, the lands of Corvuria can be left to low intensity grazing, mining and logging and as hunting grounds for nobles.\nThe fertile farms of Ashfields alongside the formerly Wexonard lowlands will feed the population.\nThe monarchy oversees the integration of the economy and controls land usage to ensure the prosperity of the entire realm, tying the constituent parts together."
AD6_gunpowder_empire: "Gunpowder Empire"
AD6_gunpowder_empire_desc: "Since the aftermath of the Aldresian Crusade, the polities of the Borders and Dostanor have adopted different ways of fighting, with the Corvurians specializing in heavy cavalry while the Ashenianders and Arannese preferring infantry. Yet the future of warfare becomes with each passing decade even more clear with the adoption of gunpowder weaponry, from guns to siege or field artillery, being rapid and universal.\nThe Arannese always make sure to remind people they were the first in the empire to adopt and specialize in the usage of field artillery and have been at the forefront of tactical innovations ever since.\nOne of the most prominent thinkers and commander of the 17th century, Calos síl Marrlin, has written many treatises on how to best use artillery both during battles and sieges alike, most prominent of his works was his 1650 book \"The Great Art of Artillery\", which was read all across Cannor and was regarded as a quasi-holy text by all Arannese officers as well as officers of the latter Vivin Imperial army.\nThe strength of the Arannese army and their ability to seize the throne of Asheniande and Corvuria alike is often ascribed to marital opportunism and luck by popular imagination, yet experts on the topic will readily acknowledge the Arannese forward-thinking of being a very important ingredient behind the formation of the Vivin Empire and its survival through the century of Camirian hegemony."
AD6_peace_vivin: "Peace of Vivin"
AD6_peace_vivin_desc: "The reputation of the Roilsardi families of the Borders is one of constant infighting and feuds, but this chapter of our history has come to a close.\nThe Borders and Dostanor are now unified under one single dynasty that maintains internal peace and directs the fighting spirit of the nobles towards foreign adventures.\nWhile the many castles deep inside our land are still largely maintained, they now double as palaces and centers of recreations for the prospering nobility.\nThere is not a day without one corner of the empire celebrating one of the many festivals of our multi-national empire and not one of these festivals will be missed by members of the dynasty, always ready to remind the people the reason for their prosperity."

AD6_corvurian_riverine_desc: "…For example, investment in logging, mining, and riverine infrastructure along the Carnvord and Dostanesck rivers. With ample resources provided by our Corvurian lands, ably extracted by peasants, and transported to factories in Arannen, I am confident that our realm will be able to cement itself as a leading industrial power. Industrial costs would be lower if it were possible to build factories within Corvuria itself, but the comparative lack of literacy amongst the simpleton workforce as well as… more esoteric concerns render that politically impractical for the time being...\"\n\n- Magister Ostan of Varlosen, in his essay 'A Survey of our Corvurian Lands', to Ostan IV síl Vivin-Arannen, 1801"
AD6_one_god: "One God, One Regent"
AD6_one_god_desc: "The reveal of the death of Castellos shocked Cannorian society at its core.\nWith faith in the rulers at all time low, the clergy and nobles of all corners of the continent tried to lessen the impact of the revelation and to find a new coherent explanation for why Cannorian societies were ordered as they were.\nIn Corvuria, the revelation came and went with the impoverished peasantry unable to even dare to question their state of affairs, but in the lands of Arannen and Asheniande the shock was felt immensely and the monarchies had to face many peasant and burgher uprising against their rule. In the 17th century, as the wars that lead to the formation of the Vivin Empire raged, the monarchs of the síl Arannen and síl Vivin dynasties adopted an ideology of enlightened rulership, where the monarch had to strive to the betterment of their society and the harmony between its constituent classes, from the poorest of peasants to the richest of the nobles.\nThe spread of Ravelian society was encouraged in the Corinite lands of Arannen and Asheniande as the societies pledged loyalty and support for the monarchs that funded and supported them. The formation of the Ravelian Church would eventually lead to the formal conversion of the Vivin imperial family to the faith, even if the religion was only marginal in the more rural and marginal lands of Corvuria.\nWhen in centuries prior the Cannorian monarchs regarded themselves as regents of Castellos, the Vivin Emperors started regarding themselves as regent of either Corin at first and later on of the one true god and steward of his teachings and gift to the world. It is only natural for the people to follow the lead and commands of the regent of god."

AD8_wexonard_republican_spirit: "Wexonard Republican Spirit"
AD8_wexonard_republican_spirit_desc: "The Damerians are proud of their parliamentary institutions, which date back to the age of the old republic. However, the Wexonards also have a history of strong republican traditions, with their kings being elected during the period of the first two kingdoms. Just as important is the Wexonard tradition of villages and towns electing the bravest and best among their people to guide and represent them against the overbearing demands of local or foreign lords. The grand dukes of Wexonard attempted to redirect our spirit by concentrating talent and ambition within their large court, while the Sugambrian dukes have sought to deceive us by allowing the people to create a batch of candidates for official positions, while the true power to appoint and dismiss remained with the duke. The nobles of Bisanese have shown interest in Damerian parliamentarism, but have not fully embraced its principles. As a result, many of their burghers have moved to nearby free cities to pursue opportunities they lacked under Bisan rule. The duchies' shortcomings can and will be overcome by the League. Talented and ambitious Wexonards will no longer be overshadowed by mediocre or indolent dukes who have inherited their positions through their forebears' talents. Instead, cities and villages will elect their own leaders, who will elect one of their own to lead the Wexonard people to glory."
AD8_land_of_heroes: "Land of Warriors"
AD8_land_of_heroes_desc: "A lot of cities in Wexonard lands have been named after great warriors from the past, like Rhinmond, Indlebury and Magdalaire. These heroes risked their lives to defend or free the land, and no demon-worshipping gnolls, Milcori necromancers, Escanni witch-kings or even our own powerful noble-mages like Lothane could break the courage and spirit of these warriors. But no time of peace lasts forever, and the Wexonards always have to be on the lookout for new threats. They should remember the stories of the people whose names are on the biggest cities of modern Wex – they're an example to everyone, from kids and young warriors who want to be like them to respected elders and modern-day leaders."
AD8_homeland_of_halves: "Home of the 'Halves'"
AD8_homeland_of_halves_desc: "The western half of the Wexonard Corridor, which forms the core of the League, has also been the new home of the Halflings since the arrival of the Wexonards, who, like us, fled the Dragonwake and the hordes of Godrac. Centuries later, the elves and their mixed descendants would also join us and populate every corner of the western lowlands.\n\nWhile the nobles of Wex have also considered themselves Elvenized, the true and fullest expression of Elven and Half-Elven culture in the lands of Wex could be found in the city of Magdalaire, Aelthíl or the area around Escandar, where peoples at all levels of society have adopted and mixed Elven practices and traditions with Wexonard, with Wexonard Halflings being the greatest and most successful promoters of Wexonard culture to our neighbours, increasing our prestige and respect abroad.\n\nThe Halflings of Wex have been our most unscrupulous supporters, even if they couldn't find a place for themselves in the traditional Wexonard martial arts such as Wexonard fencing or even Sugambrian horsemanship, they have instead helped us through subterfuge, spying and infiltration, something we have always valued since our back-handed takeover of Wexkeep."
AD8_forges_textiles: "Forges of the Hills, Textiles of the Plains"
AD8_forges_textiles_desc: "The discovery of Aelantir and the subsequent expansion of oceanic trade have resulted in a gradual weakening of the Borders' role as a trade entrepot for Bulwari and Escanni goods, a process that has accelerated over the past century.The establishment of the Wexonard League has enabled the cities to assume responsibility for addressing this long-term threat to economic prosperity. The lands of Wex have historically been prominent in iron production in the empire, and the upper Cotumer region has also demonstrated economic vitality.\n\nHowever, the lowlands between Rhinmond and Cotumer have suffered economic decline due to their remote location, vulnerability to Gnollish raids, and leadership by negligent nobles. In order to ensure the survival of the empire in this new and larger world, it is essential to be at the forefront of economic dynamism and industrial expansion.\n\nSmall towns such as Vinerick and Rupellion must be expanded, and the forests of Bardswood must be economically exploited and cut down to make more room for productive farms feeding the new cities of the middle lowlands. The iron mines and forges in the highlands will be expanded to produce superior tools for our farmers, artisans, builders and soldiers alike. The pastoralists outside of the mining towns will also be supported and directed to produce sufficient wool for our expanding weaving industry alongside the Cotumer and in Rhinmond, in order to avoid the risk of the expanding Arannese textile industries flooding our own market with their inferior and unappealing colors."
AD8_riflemen_league: "Riflemen of the League"
AD8_riflemen_league_desc: "Traditionally, the primary ambition for the average Wexonard foot soldier was to learn and master the art of Wexonard fencing and wield a well-crafted greatsword in battle. However, the advent of gunpowder has led to a shift in focus among generals and leaders towards the adoption and proliferation of guns and artillery. This is partly because the majority of greatsword users are from the upper nobility, who have viewed the league with a degree of distrust, at best, or active rebellion, at worst.\n\nDespite these secondary motives, the spread of guns has seen great success and has also helped to foster a sense of loyalty to the league, which has offered new avenues for the urban commoners who were previously unable to pay for the expensive and strenuous equipment and training required to master Wexonard fencing.\n\nAt the forefront of this military revolution are numerous Wexonard Half-Elves seeking to combine the archery traditions of their Elven half with the ferocity and aggressiveness of their Wexonard half. The Dwarves of Silverforge have also thrived, founding the earliest artillery-producing forges in Ironhill and Wexkeep and transmitting ancient and rediscovered Dwarven wisdom stemming from the adventurers in the Spine. The first Dwarves and Elves of Wex have constructed impressive castles and forts, and the modern-day Dwarves and Half-Elves of Wex are in charge of innovations in armies and creators of weapons that will be capable of destroying the very same kind of castles."
AD8_old_blood_new_money: "Old Blood and New Money"
AD8_old_blood_new_money_desc: "Some members of the nobility, particularly the upper echelons, have expressed strong resistance to the League since its establishment, seeking its overthrow and the restoration of duchies with themselves at the helm. However, many lower nobles have opted to engage in electoral politics in rural areas, achieving success and appealing to a population that still holds ancient lineages and dynasties of local renown in high regard. Even among self-governing cities like Magdalaire, power has been shared among a transient class of merchants and artisans, and among pompous half-elven nobles who, despite their titles, have not owned land for many generations.\n\nConsequently, the political landscape of the league is not dominated by a single sector of society or the economy. Instead, noble lineages predominate in certain rural regions of Sugamber, merchants play a dominant role in the politics of Aelcandar, and artisans have a strong presence in cities such as Aelthil and Corseton. Some formerly major noble houses have also transitioned into mercantile endeavours, with the descendants of house síl Rhinmond being well represented in the textile industry of Rhinmond and house Robacard of Ironhill abandoning superfluous activities they were burdened with during the ducal period and focusing solely on their iron mining and weaponry production.\n\nThe intricate web of relationships among these individuals, a blend of self-made men, second-generation sons of prominent businessmen, proud and traditional noblemen, noblemen-turned-industrial barons, and successful officers, poses a significant challenge to navigating the political dynamics of the league. However, it ensures a diverse range of skills and mindsets are represented, contributing to the strength and resilience of the collective."
AD8_mercenary_state: "The Mercenary State"
AD8_mercenary_state_desc: "Wexonards have never shied away from violence. However, their ability to channel that violence into non-self-destructive activities has often been less than they would like. The decentralisation of Anbennar, which they helped to bring about, and the fall of the chivalric Escann have provided opportunities for the League's Wexonards.\n\nContrary to Lothane's ambitions, the League's leadership is wary of vast expansion, seeking instead to play off its neighbours against each other and to expand Wex's commercial and diplomatic interests in a less blunt manner, though the League's army remains large and as active as ever, now fighting for pay and favours instead of princely and dynastic feuds. Despite their best efforts to regain their fallen reputation after the sacking of Anbenncost, the Wexonards don't lament the fact that their troops are still as feared and respected as they were in the aftermath of the 4th Lilac War. The potential enemies of the Wex are very careful not to offend or hurt our interests. They are always aware of our threat to offer cheap soldiers to their other enemies.\n\nThe drums, the drums. The drums are beating. Peasants, look out! The Wexonard riflemen are approaching!"
