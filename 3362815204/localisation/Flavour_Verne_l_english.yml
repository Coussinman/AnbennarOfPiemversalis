A33_lilac_war_aftermath_title: "Aftermath of the Lilac wars"
A33_lilac_war_aftermath_desc: "The lilac wars seem to be at their end leaving a destructive finale that has wrecked through our lands. It has left villages and cities derelict and decrypt but worst of all our levies have been left depleted and spent. We are fortunate to have many adventurers returning from the end of the greentide but such an advantage should not be used to postpone a rebuilding of our forces and should indeed be used for the opposite purpose."

A33_conquer_hill_gnolls_title: "Clearing Khenak"
A33_conquer_hill_gnolls_desc: "The Gnolls of the Khenak have long been a thorn in our side for control of the rich mountain range. With the fall of Dameria a refound independence has left us able to muster the troops and will to mount a campaign against them again. This time their foolish delusions of sovereignty and troublesome raids will be put to an end."

A33_gnollish_question_title: "Administrating Khenak"
A33_gnollish_question_desc: "With the conquest of the Hill Gnolls we have found that they are far more divided then popularly and previously believed. This has led to a great deal of issues in attempts to govern the population as a great deal of unrest is spread even moving a small pack but also lends them less immediate loyalty to their previous warlord. The question now arises whether or not to lean into privileging the numerous packs of the Khenak or to try to brace the unrest and move them to extract the Khenak’s riches."

A33_egg_hunt_title: "The Hunt for Eggs"
A33_egg_hunt_desc: "The disappearance of wyverns from our armies has for many generations been a blight on our legacy and a source of constant longing bitter nostalgia. Since our recent conquest of the Khenak more and more sightings of wyverns have occurred, as if it was divine providence. We should surely investigate this, but it will require quite a bit of money at the minimum and devoting additional resources might be for the best, as well."

A33_drake_sanctuary_title: "Build the sanctuary"
A33_drake_sanctuary_desc: "In order to carefully hatch our wyvern eggs and see them mature into fearsome but loyal beasts, we need to construct a proper sanctuary for them. We shall hire the greatest druids, animal trainers, and reptile enthusiasts we can find to inform us of the best conditions and ways to keep them safe and healthy."

A33_wyverns_back_title: "Tameing the Wyverns"
A33_wyverns_back_desc: "While we have constructed a suitable sanctuary, it is said that the first wyvern rider Armoc Vernid was aided by loyal mages to increase his strength, affinity, and more importantly: the chance that the wyvern will bond with its would-be rider. We must do the same, in addition to properly warding the structure or else our enemies may steal our secrets."

A33_wyverns_rider_title: "To Ride a Drake"
A33_wyverns_rider_desc: "The reintroduction of Wyverns into our Armies and battlefields has brought an excellent tactical advantage to our battlefields though not without its issues. Unfortunately the riding of Wyverns has been described as incredibly difficult with proper commands and movement being just as. As a result, our wyvern regiments have relied on ad hoc recruitment with there being little in the way of standardized training or recorded knowledge to ensure effective control and deployment. A concerted effort to make a dedicated professional training standard and process for our regiments must be made to realize the potential of our regiments."

A33_wyverns_general_locked_title: "Locked Mission"
A33_wyverns_general_locked_desc: ""

A33_wyverns_general_title: "wyvern Generals"
A33_wyverns_general_desc: "In the chronicles of history about our wyvern past, a historically neglected but recently greatly appreciated facet of our wyverns has been their non-combat roles. The officer on wyvernback is a far superior form of authority than that of horseback, and is also granted a more maneuverable and survivable mount. This effect is also appreciated in the higher ranks of command, as it has allowed our generals better command and survey of the battlefield. Some of the generalship's fascination with the creatures has helped to utilize them to their utmost tactical potential but has suffered from it being a small clique. The curriculum and facilities to promote this clique and always allow a capable wyvern general should be now invested in."

A33_verne_kingdom_title: "Longing for the Past "
A33_verne_kingdom_desc: "Very few in their right senses would have questioned the Vernman commitment to the moon party's cause but with Dameria now dismantled and the territory they so painfully took from our Kingdom of Verne out of their hold some nostalgic views have began to resurface. Dameria had dismantled and annexed northern territories of the old kingdom and demoted our politely to a duchy with the formation of the empire and their hegemony over it cementing this. Now however the lilac wars have thoroughly cracked this circumstance and calls to reclaim the kingdom have begun to resurface. "

A33_pearls_ambition_title: "Remembering the Present"
A33_pearls_ambition_desc: "The nostalgia of our past glories must not blind us from our current struggles. Across the straits of the dameshead approach lies our ever plotting competitor for supremacy over the dames necklace Pearlsedge. Their current hold over The Pearls leaves them with too good an upper hand in our current rivalry and must be rectified."

A33_surpass_pears_title: "Surpassing Pearlsedge"
A33_surpass_pears_desc: "The rivalry with Pearlsedge can only end with their downfall and subservience to our domination over the Damesneck. To this end their continued independence across the straits must be curved significantly lest they try to antagonize our ambitions again"

A33_fate_empire_title: "Vernish Fate in the Empire"
A33_fate_empire_desc: "The Empire of Anbennar has been anything but its namesake with its defining moments being the best essay to this point. The imperial law that is supposed to hold so much importance is often sidestepped, justified around or ignored for the sake of aggrandizement scheming and personal goals. Might seems the best argument in the Empire, something our recent de-facto reconquest of our old kingdom has proven true."

A33_wyverns_tactics_title: "Wyverns In A Modern Age"
A33_wyverns_tactics_desc: "During the long dormancy of our wyvern armies the world has changed greatly. Gunpowder has done a great toll in sweeping aside the age of chivalry which our Wyverns would be accustomed to. Despite this their greater capacity for withstanding a volley of shot will allow them with greater mass to successfully charge. To this end the current facilities must be equipped to train hardier mounts with warfare increasingly targeting strategic goals these complexes will need to be fortified."

A33_wyverns_question_title: "Reform The Regiments"
A33_wyverns_question_desc: "For far to long have we been treating and utilizing our Wyverns in traditional deployments and organizations. The nature of their size and stature should necessitate more elaborate organizations as their deployments on certain battlefields lead to underutilization or extraordinary clumsy actions and cost the organization of other regiments in the army. A new committee has formed attempting to solve this issue and have prepared plans to reform the regimental system."

A33_branching_start_title: "Vernish Politics"
A33_branching_start_desc: "The end of the 5th decade in the year 1400 after ashes shall prove to be one of the most eventful for Cannor. The end of the lilac wars and the sacrifice of Corin beating back the Greentide will undoubtedly have far more wide reaching and unforeseen effects but its consequences have already begun to rain upon Verne. Since its time in the empire Verne has stood as an oddity in the feudal ridden empire with our nobility holding very little land and power. The pilgrimage to Escann of many adventurers and the empowerment of our nobility with the lilac wars has led to a brief Resurgence of their power which now stands to clash with the return of order in Escann and the empire."

A33_noble_wanneing_title: "Erosion of the Nobility"
A33_noble_wanneing_desc: "Throughout Cannor and especially the empire feudalism has reigned as the primary governing principle in the duchy of Verne this has been a shaky control at best. The power of the nobility seems to have its final breath at the end in order to cling on to relevance in the duchy and so with their defeat comes a new document for governance, a constitution the first of its kind. The many minor landlords, freemen and especially the adventurers of the land now proclaim to be it's the constitution's guarantor so that a new freedom may reign in Verne."

A33_verne_republic_title: "A Peculiar Republic"
A33_verne_republic_desc: "Ostensibly the recent developments in verne haven't changed the de-jure nature greatly though in reality the governance and delegation of power has been dramatically changed with a more republican experiment taking place. The process of rewriting and changing centuries of feudal tradition as well as developing a republican character within our populace whilst battling subversion is long and difficult though necessary to ensure the survival of the “Peculiar Republic”."

A33_khenois_contact_title: "Tales of Republics"
A33_khenois_contact_desc: "Explorations into Aelantir have continually found remarkable and unprecedented items. Though down south to the east after an initial encounter with a brutal storm our explorers have confirmed the rumors of a republican civilization in Aelantir. Their government in some ways makes our own republic look more like the feudal monarchies that surround us though their institutions are fundamentally rather democratic after initial dialogue concludes. These republics trace their origins to the day of ashen skies it seems and the technology they hold onto seems to confirm this. Another expedition to the land for trade and to learn more seems to be in order."

A33_khenois_contender_title: "Kheionai camp"
A33_khenois_contender_desc: "After a mess of mixed orders and ambition of men on the ground we have now acquired a sizable staging ground for operations in Kheionai. Consolidating our position and administration in the region should allow us to fight for influence and the bountiful trade of the region better."

A33_khenois_conquests_title: "Crossing the Cleaved Sea"
A33_khenois_conquests_desc: "The colonies where we landed in Kheionai are not greatly connected to the mainland though further north lies the cleaved sea with archipelago dotting its waters. Control of the eastern side of the sea will allow us to properly contest and maintain the best waterways and islands that connect to Devand."

A33_khenois_hegemony_title: "Subjugation of the Kheionai"
A33_khenois_hegemony_desc: "The Kheionai hold treasures that are unseen and extraordinarily rare in Cannor. This exotic aura that has begun to surround them has prompted many more adventures to join the incursion onto their land in the search for fame, treasure and glory. The newest and largest adventurer band raised and the popular sentiment in our territory in the region wants to see the whole of the Kheionai consumed into Vernman control."

A33_khenois_new_age_title: "A New Age in Kheionai"
A33_khenois_new_age_desc: "The toppling of the old Kheionai states was unseen to many even within our own court but it seems now that Vernman authority will hold an uncontested control over the Kheionai. With this we must attempt total control of the isles and seek to solidify this new era as a lasting one. "

A33_eordland_expidition_title: "Battling the Deathwind"
A33_eordland_expidition_desc: "The deathwind has existed as an existential threat to the Kheionai since their formation, the collection of ill understood and deadly sand that blows from the Kaydhano has fascinated researchers and thrill seekers since we have made contact. A collection of both of the former has begun to develop a vessel that could carry the protective shield of the Kheionai cities with it for some time. This innovation could allow for an unprecedented connection northward as well as the potential to understand the deathwinds far better. "

A33_explorations_title: "A New Type of Adventure"
A33_explorations_desc: "Since the elves arrived from the west expeditions to attempt to find where they had come from had been launched and launched to much dismay. The great and enigmatic navigating talents of those like Munas seemed to be once in an elves' generation and any old attempt west was met with immense trouble. Recent developments in navigation and technology have helped explorers move farther and farther west and return. It is a development we must keep up with."

A33_land_ho_title: "Discovery of a Lifetime"
A33_land_ho_desc: "It seems the Dame has been pointing west for good reason across Uelos’ lament lies another land mass. Questions on what this continent holds and it has racked the mind of all diviners and learned men. Is it the homeland of the elves a connection to the past many do not know, what every Vernman knows is that it is an adventure in waiting."

A33_first_colony_title: "A new Camp"
A33_first_colony_desc: "The travel to Aelantir despite the greatest navigation tools of the age and the best sailors lies a treacherous journey more so without them. It will be needed to continue exploring the continents to establish a base within Aelantir. A forward camp on the doorstep of Aelantir would go a long way in the adventure of this new world."

A33_taychend_contact_title: "Tales of Warlords"
A33_taychend_contact_desc: "Initial expeditions into South Aelantir had found inhospitable jungles leading to a great mountain range scrapping many hopes and adventures. Some passageways have since been found and coastal connections showing that these mountains had hid a great civilization. These ruinborn seem to be a collection of statelets that would put satirists of the Empire out of work as warlordism seems to be all these ruinborn know."

A33_taychend_contender_title: "Taychendi Foothold"
A33_taychend_contender_desc: "Trade in the war-torn Taychend has necessitated bringing security into our own hands. Efforts to protect traders and diplomats will need a base to project our power from only then may this land be understood and its secrets uncovered. "

A33_colonial_method_title: "An Adventurer Method"
A33_colonial_method_desc: "Amongst the colonizing powers we stand once again unique amongst the despots throughout our push into the Aelantir free Vernman adventurers led the way. The great pilgrimages of Vernmen to foreign wars have gradually shifted to include looking for a nice spot of the seemingly endless land in Aelantir. This zealous group of volunteers well equipped for an adventure has led to a far different experience of colonialism in Verne."

A33_colonial_reform_title: "Reform the Method"
A33_colonial_reform_desc: "Our Colonial method has been a lead to the conquest of some of the greatest empires of Aelantir. Though the method has hardly been great for the governance of vast territories and has led to the underdevelopment of regions. It has led to some sloppy governance and control over our theoretically vast empire and as such new conditions propel a change in our method."

A33_legacy_of_conquistadors_title: "Legacy of the Conquerors"
A33_legacy_of_conquistadors_desc: "The early expeditions to Taychend and the Kheionai were led by conquistadors of legendary fame battling elements and armies against all odds. Their legacy lives in our vast possessions in Aelantir but also in the regiments that evolved from their initial expeditions. These long lasting regiments can prove to be an incredibly loyal and tactical tool for conflicts in the region we may only need to establish their tradition and formalize them."

A33_riding_waves_title: "Riding the Waves"
A33_riding_waves_desc: "While we are better known for our historical wyvern riders, Vernmen are also some of Cannor's most daring sailors! We should build a navy to make use of this."

A33_new_friends_title: "New Friends"
A33_new_friends_desc: "In the Lilac Wars, we sided with Dameria to spite our rivals over in Pearlsedge. However, neighboring Busilar decided to side with Lorent! Luckily, their rivals, Eborthíl, went for Dameria and fought alongside us! Although confusing, this convoluted web of rivalries has earned us some new friends!"

A33_busilari_ambition_title: "Anti Busilari pact"
A33_busilari_ambition_desc: "Although the Lion Armada was thoroughly destroyed during the lilac wars, Busilar has still advanced its ambitions against both Eborthil and us. A defensive pact to contain Busilari Ambition against our nations should need no real thought though how to deal with them might need more."

A33_conquer_businor_title: "Slaying the Lion"
A33_conquer_businor_desc: "Busilar has been to great a threat to both Eborthil and Verne its partition inevitable as we clashed for dominance over the Divenhal. Now the less immediate threats of the Divenhal can be tackled with the wholesale resources of the once squabbling Cannorian powers."

A33_fighting_pirates_title: "An Expedition to Sarhal"
A33_fighting_pirates_desc: "Along the Divenhal lies a scourge of pirates and slavers. these if they were any other kingdom in Cannor could be perhaps diplomatically resolved however these raider ships are commanded by gnolls sponsored by a "great" gnollish state across from Eborthil. As we are left with no other option the time to outfit an expedition to combat these forces where they stand in Sarhal seems opportune."

A33_ending_pirates_title: "Ending Gnollish Piracy"
A33_ending_pirates_desc: "The gnolls of the Ekha coastline have long misused and abused the good harbors of the area to indulge in their slaving traditions. To this end their captives must be freed and their ports confiscated so that they may never terrorize our coasts again. Resettling the formerly enslaved into some of these ports should ensure gratitude and loyalty to our influence in the region."

A33_taychend_conquestss_title: "A New Warlord"
A33_taychend_conquestss_desc: "Our man on the ground "notpizzaro" has uncovered a great precursor city in the taychend. The desire to have more contact with this city and the continued encroachment against our territory has prompted another campaign to begin a conquest of the region. Already many men flock to "notpizzaro" as another ambitious warlord and he has entertained the thought."

A33_taychendi_hegemonys_title: "Taychendi Hegemony"
A33_taychendi_hegemonys_desc: "The end of a conquest in Taychend seems to just be the beginning for another as each statelet is not content with the defeat of a hegemon. Every new border we seek to sweep of banditry and rogue armies seems to just move us into a new one we must seek to have our power in the region be respected and unchallenged and perhaps then peace can come to the land."

A33_taychend_consolidation_title: "Surpassing the Warlord Cycle"
A33_taychend_consolidation_desc: "Unity in Taychend has come many times but it is never long lasting the succession of strongmen becomes weaker each generation until it collapses and another contest of warlords begins. Exploitation and exploration of the land cannot be done until we can rid it of this cycle. We must ensure that our order of Taychend escapes it and to do so we need to ensure that order is unchallenged."

A33_taychend_wealth_title: "Precursor Expeditions"
A33_taychend_wealth_desc: "The great Veyil Sikhara mountain range we cursed at when we first encountered it as an obstacle but now many researchers and adventurers bless it as a savior. The mountain range although not perfectly helped to protect precursor remnants from the day of ashen skies. Taychend as such is the home to many precursor sites in much better condition then many are in Aelantir. "

A33_grain_yield_title: "Rebuilding The Breadbasket"
A33_grain_yield_desc: "In the days of the old kingdom of Verne the upper loop served as a breadbasket for not only our kingdom but for much of the east Dameshead. The current division of the old kingdom and the growth of cities has led to the need to import grain now which helps to contribute to our current demographic difficulties. If we are able to reduce our dependence on importing grains the plight of the unemployed will be made better and the diaspora of young Vernman reduced."

A33_stable_agriculture_title: "Veteran Land Rights"
A33_stable_agriculture_desc: "Eventually the harvest of young Vernman by the call of glory reaps a class of veterans in varying degrees of wealth. For the less wealthy or more injured amongst them they often return to their younger lives of impoverishment in cities or look for whatever work they can maybe find. Inspired by veteran land grants Jaher gave to his veteran legionaries, if we were able to give these veterans land to work and improve on we can help to employ them as well as improving the land in our hinterlands."

A33_grand_rigotta_title: "The Grand Rigotta"
A33_grand_rigotta_desc: "Current understanding of the geography of Halann has cemented the belief of it being a self contained sphere. Many of our merchants as well have told tales of their journeys when mapped together and when from enough of them can build a trail across the whole of Halann of a passage through the oceans to circumnavigate the world. This triumph would be the penultimate testament to the seaworthiness of Vernman sailors and has already led many Rigotta officials planning to buy new outposts and prepare new maps."

A33_khenak_copper_title: "Red Brass Monopoly"
A33_khenak_copper_desc: "With the development of early bombards the need for copper across Cannor has increased substantially much to the glee of landholders in the Khenak. A new company has formed to organize the export of the popular "Red Brass" The Vernman Bronze and Artillery company which has been granted a complete monopoly of the manufacture and distribution of red brass by the Emperor. Fostering their company will help forge a healthy balance of trade as well as build a great metallurgy tradition within our country."

A33_metallurgy_tradition_title: "Masters of Metallurgy"
A33_metallurgy_tradition_desc: "Whilst copper and bronze has been incredibly popular and effective to make a bombard it has begun to evolve. Making the bombard lighter and more field capable has been demanded since its inception along with attempts to replace bronze for a form of steel in attempts to make it stronger. If we are to retain our expertise in metallurgy expanding our horizons into forging iron and steel will need to be necessary. "

A33_develop_commerce_title: "Invigorating Divenhal Trade"
A33_develop_commerce_desc: "The moon party in the lilac wars had after a hard fought battle enjoyed a healthy naval dominance with this came the seizure of merchant ships laden with exotic goods coming across the Divenhal giving a taste and supply for luxury across Verne. The conclusion of the lilac wars has left many well off captains and the demobilization of many warship with some contracts and charters may help to establish these luxury trade routes through our lands."

A33_commerce_hubs_title: "Invest in Vernman Cities"
A33_commerce_hubs_desc: "The tale of the Vernman city is that of triumphant precessions happening along every street, enough men to form a new mercenary company being recruited across every tavern with the headquarters of several companies signing a new contract every week. The reality is far less glamorous as the many impoverished of the cities are often lulled into mercenary work through desperation and empty promises. There must be an effort made to improve the amount of commerce in our cities to provide work outside of war. "

A33_adventurer_trade_title: "Adventurous Trading "
A33_adventurer_trade_desc: "Trade has been ever expanding globally and unfortunately the need to protect it across threats globally has developed alongside it. If we were to offer our well established mercenary services on a smaller scale as guards to different merchantmen who pass through our ports it would help ensure safe commerce. In this vain if it helps to attach our profit onto the detrimental effects of an import and perhaps profit off of trade not necessarily directed towards our nation with enough success. "

A33_balance_title: "Balancing Demographics"
A33_balance_desc: "The woeful state of Verne of centuries past has been banished into the distant memory. Now where the only refuge to impoverishment in the cities was export to a foreign lords war stands plentiful and safe commerce. The bum legged veteran no longer finds himself as a beggar but with a safe plot of land upon his return. Whilst our artisans' fame in metallurgy has began to compete with our prowess as mercenaries."

A33_sarhali_knowledge_title: "A New Race"
A33_sarhali_knowledge_desc: "Every twenty years since its beginning, we have held the Stingport Regatta. A great race towards the not so distant island of the same namesake. This year with the continued advancement of ocean travel a new target has been suggested by gamesmaster towards the Sarhali port fortune. This suggestion has had all accept the challenge though it marks a new day in the Regatta."

A33_clove_hunting_title: "Adventure For Cloves"
A33_clove_hunting_desc: "Along the southern end of Sarhal lies the Fahvanosy isles home to an extraordinarily rare spice in cloves. These isles and their export can be a great good to monopolize on top of being a better position to reliably trade with Sarhal."

A33_moving_coast_title: "Controlling the Clove Trade"
A33_moving_coast_desc: "The Cloves trade is quickly becoming one of the most competitive contests for trade control in all of Halann.In order to not be subject to the whims and tariffs of other colonial powers we must stake our share in the cloves trade before it is too late."

A33_moving_inland_title: "Moving Inland"
A33_moving_inland_desc: "Trade with Sarhal is quickly proving to be one of the greatest new sources of growing trade with its unique goods. Moving onto the main body of Sarhal has continually proven to be needed to secure our interests against local and other colonial powers. "

A33_sarhally_base_title: "Sarhal Dominion"
A33_sarhally_base_desc: "Protection of interests and competition with the other Cannorian powers has prompted the need for a far larger territory in Sarhal to govern. To protect against local and foreign threats in a prolonged campaign it becomes necessary to have a depth in our defenses and local resources to sustain an army. These can only come from the aggrandizement of our current possessions. "

A33_rounding_sarhal_title: "Rounding Fangaula"
A33_rounding_sarhal_desc: "Our Explorers have began to get bearings around the eastern end of sarhal finding that it wraps around west. This discovery and its implications of another route to the east has enticed many more explorers to help map the area which has lead to the discovery of many fantastical and dangerous properties of the Fangaula jungles."

A33_rounding_east_title: "Rounding Ardimya"
A33_rounding_east_desc: "Hopes of an easy sailing and connection to eastern Halann were dashed when our explorers came across the jutting landmass of Ardimya. The southern route east as it has been called however has still been left with interest trade with Merfolk and favorable winds along the great Insyaa storm has led to the desire of an establishment of base in the area. The landmass of Ardimya is too treacherous though the many islands that surround the land mass have been favorable. "

A33_halessi_bases_title: "Halessi Doormat"
A33_halessi_bases_desc: "Connection to the Haless along the south is a long and expensive journey, though it can be done primarily through the sea and on one ship. This has helped allow Vernman Merchants through a single journey of their own access into Halless where exotic goods can be bought and traded quite easily. Our merchants however despise the foreign taxation and despotism that has entangled them through their journey away through their homeland and now ask to establish an authority to protect them in Haless. "

A33_halessi_influence_title: "A Halessi Adventure"
A33_halessi_influence_desc: "One of the less exotic but still desired exports to Halless has been predictably that of Vernman Adventurers. These adventurers offering Cannorian tactics and strategies to the entrenched Hallessi warlords has been a desired ingredient for success, though a recent matter has been of more intrigue to all Cannorians in the region. An expedition to a High temple has hired a contingent of our bravest typically shunned and shooed away from these temples. It could be an excellent opportunity to see what lies within."

A33_yin_expo_title: "A Ynnic Expedition"
A33_yin_expo_desc: "South Aelantir was not unique in holding a large Ruinborn civilization up the treacherous cliffs of ruin and along the river Ynn lies another major Ruinborn civilization. For many people it is a far off and commercial venture though for some within the colonies it represents a conquest that could match the legendary southern ones. Controlling the Ynn outlet into the Trollsbay could prove an ample commercial and staging ground for the region."

A33_yin_truimph_title: "Ynnic Glory"
A33_yin_truimph_desc: "The Ynnic Expanse is perhaps as difficult to manage and live in as it is vast. This has not dissuaded many different independent Cannorian parties from attempting to claim a piece of land. These adventurers however may be amicable however to our colonial administration and an invitation to fold them into our influence may be in order."

A33_eordland_expo_title: "An Expedition to Eordand"
A33_eordland_expo_desc: "Eordand is land of season, mystery, the fey and precursor relics. Their isolation and unity has prevent much interference in their land though the bounty it has prompted many attempts. This wealth and connection to the mystery of the fey has built interest in another grand expedition to conduct a campaign of conquest and exploration into Eordand."

A33_eordland_truimph_title: "Into the Feyrealms"
A33_eordland_truimph_desc: "The fey prove an elusive mystery though their secrets and origins lie within the Domandrod. Finding an Understanding of the fey realm can certainly be found along with no shortage of eager adventurers looking to make a name for themselves. "

A33_vernman_granduchy_title: "Grand Duchy of Verne"
A33_vernman_granduchy_desc: "The formation of the Empire saw the creation of Grand duchies based off of the traditional kingdoms that joined to form the Anbennar. The old kingdom of Verne was declared ineligible as it was absorbed by the Damerians, a decision made to strengthen their position. Our hold over the old territories of the kingdom and our influence can perhaps help revise this and mold imperial law to allow our aggrandizement."

A33_meritcratical_empire_title: "A Meritocratic Empire"
A33_meritcratical_empire_desc: "The lilac wars not only tour apart the empire's territory and balance of power but also its traditions and laws. Notable rose party members like Wex and Sugamber used the chaos and desperation to aggrandize their realms at the detriment to traditional powers in the empire. This could spell the opportunity to strip their occupations from them and return them to a new and competent local ruler who governs for the benefit of the empire and its local provinces."

A33_expanding_sphere_title: "Reforge Dameria"
A33_expanding_sphere_desc: "Dameria in the de-jure imperial law still exists though no coronation has taken place for a grand duke in some time and will likely never happen regularly. This is perhaps where we can change things and choose a new grand duke to lead our influence in the Dameshead. Uniting the region will take some favors and genuine friendships though arguments for common defense the past union and the promise of the title of grand duke can make compelling arguments. "

A33_novus_homen_title: "New Nobility"
A33_novus_homen_desc: "The nobility in Verne not content with their possible extinction, seem to have finally been able to adapt to the circumstances in the duchy. This evolution has however fundamentally changed the nature of nobility as the lesser land owners are given some slight favors and preferential treatment to throw in their lot with the new nobility. Big tent politics tend to lead to infighting and as the nobles still insist on tiering themselves it has fomented a divide amongst the older and newer nobility."

A33_imperial_bid_title: "Imperial Ambition"
A33_imperial_bid_desc: "The empire despite the end of the lilac wars has still found themselves split into the old dove and rose parties. This split threatens to make the election another point to restart the lilac wars. A Vernish candidacy could help break this narrative as we are a lesser and certainly not main character in the rose and dove party conflicts and far more likeable then the illegitimate Wexonards."

A33_border_mark_title: "Reinforcing the Borders"
A33_border_mark_desc: "The de-jure borders of the Empire in the face of rival Cannorian powers are often trampled, ignored and laughed at. To this end we must seek to reestablish the authority of the empire in the region by bolstering the imperial marches. With this we will have made a firm stance on the Empire's sovereignty marking our emperorship as one for the Empire."

A33_reorganize_wex_title: "Reorganizing the Wexonards"
A33_reorganize_wex_desc: "The grand duchy of Wex has in the lilac wars egregiously aggrandized itself in the lilac wars. Throwing away imperial law when it suited them to carve out a dominion across territory it had no claim to. This was also done in Sugamber a state where the succession squabbles hardly entitle some territory it holds. The Wexonards as such must have their illegal occupations ended, an imperial sanction levied on them and their borders shown to them by force of arms."

A33_imperial_diet_title: "Uplifting the Imperial Diet"
A33_imperial_diet_desc: "The imperial diet has long since been continually losing power and its voice within the Empire. Many voices now call for reforms to have its power and influence restored, a move which combined with empowering the lower courts of the Empire could help to weaken the challenging influence of the larger states and electors of the empire. Reforming our own diet to be entwined with the imperial one will also secure our position as emperor."

A33_empire_prosperity_title: "A True Anbennar"
A33_empire_prosperity_desc: "The namesake for which the empire is called has often been a point of mockery as since its existence unity would be a choice word to use to describe Anbennar. However the Vernmen emperorship have helped revive this name through our reforms and general popularity amongst the princes."

A33_empire_the_borders_title: "Borders no More"
A33_empire_the_borders_desc: "The borders have long since been the frontier of the Empire. It is one of the few connections to both Escann and Bulwar where any invasion from either must past through it. To combat and prepare against this eventuality the region is dotted with margraves and marches which has led to limited development of the region. Seeing as the borders have long since been established as part of the imperial domain we must seek to embellish and uplift them."

A33_empire_dostanort_title: "Anbennarian Dostanor"
A33_empire_dostanort_desc: "The old Empire of Castan gifted the region of Dostanor its namesake though now it is hardly connected to the former. In order to expand the empires influence we will have to seek to destroy the old notion that Dostanor is a fundamentally Escanni region and establish an Anbennarian claim to the region."

A33_profitable_colonies_title: "Ripe for Adventure"
A33_profitable_colonies_desc: "The lands of Aelantir are unknown, vast and wild traits that make it the ultimate adventure and has drawn many already to the region. Verne’s reputation as a center of Adventurer activity can help greatly in expanding our efforts to control territory in the region. Levying our unique abilities in our efforts in Aelantir will only cost an investment that's less than other great powers are making for similar effects. "

A33_exile_troublesome_title: "Exile the Troublesome"
A33_exile_troublesome_desc: "The nature of the current politics in Verne has empowered radical and antagonist factions that would target the nature of governance. These troublesome adventurer factions and groups with some encouragement and assignments can be effectively contained and exiled to Aelantir. Though harsh and dangerous in allowing them to scheme together their political influence will suffer from their distance to the court."

A33_aelentir_domination_title: "Aelantir Domination"
A33_aelentir_domination_desc: "Aelantir has the ability to forge a great empire with its abundant lands and access to precursor secrets. We must continue to expand our influence into the region if not to empower ourselves but to prevent our rivals from acquiring this power."

A33_reign_in_col_title: "The Colonial Authority"
A33_reign_in_col_desc: "Governance in the colonies has always been troublesome but the recent turmoil has fundamentally altered societal connections from the mainland to the colonies. The question on the limit of authority and local control the colonies may have will be decided now. It will be decided in a messy and brutal conflict though hopefully for good."

A33_khet_fight_title: "Challenging the Khet"
A33_khet_fight_desc: "The kingdom of Kheterata is an old and powerful kingdom and major player in the Divenhal. Their hegemonic attitude in the region along with the bounty their land holds will eventually lead to their fulfilled ambitions. To prevent this outcome the Khet must have their position and wealth in the region lessened."

A33_steward_mandate_title: "To Claim the Mandate"
A33_steward_mandate_desc: "The title of king of Kheterata may only be given to the people of Kheterata though it hardly stops the scheming clergy of the region from attempting to claim the title themselves or to give it out as a quid pro quo for power. It wouldn't then be impossible to revive the subjugation of Khetarata that the old Damerian republic had through claiming the mandate ourselves or through a proxy. The latter condition will surely help in preventing the folly of the old Damerian dominion of Khetarata."

A33_empire_damescrown_title: "Organize the Damescrown"
A33_empire_damescrown_desc: "The Eastern half of the Damescrown is the commercial heart of the empire though its squabbling , petty disputes between families and river barges have stunted its growth. To breakup and reorganize the Esmaria and the Damescrown into proper Grand duchies will help breakup the needless competition between the aristocratic establishment that governs the region. Hopefully with the establishment of new posts proper talent will emerge to govern fairly and competently."

A33_empire_small_country_title: "Uplift the Halflings"
A33_empire_small_country_desc: "The Elector of Beepeck has represented the Halflings within the empire for centuries though it is a shame that the majority of their brethren lie in foreign lands. We must help the halfling cause as they yearn for freedom and our oath to Beepeck to protect the halflings must extend further into the small country. "

A33_empire_elfrealm_title: "The Question of Ibevar"
A33_empire_elfrealm_desc: "Ibevar is an oddity for the bordering kingdoms of the empire as the sole independent elven monarchy. Their long standing isolation has benefited the empire though it was broken with their adoption of the gods of the regent court and participation in the lilac wars. Their potential intervention combined with their sway over elves is perhaps dangerous though with a formal invitation into the empire to further their connection to elf realms peacefully can make a good deal."

A33_empire_elfrealm_2_title: "The Elfrealms"
A33_empire_elfrealm_2_desc: "The formation of grand duchies has been useful in helping control the bickering interests of the different states in the empire and better representing their parties. The various elfrealms in the empire however are disconnected, fragmented and sometimes bickering. Uniting them into a Grand duchy will be a messy administrative affair though will grant the elves a power to hold onto their coveted territories like never before and finally allow their limited numbers to be alleviated better."

A33_empire_west_dameshead_title: "Western Security"
A33_empire_west_dameshead_desc: "The kingdom of Lorent started as a prize for Damerian emperors to be won in the Lilac wars though it ended it as emperor-maker. The threat that the rose has to the empire is immense and at any time may threaten to overrun the west dameshead. We must return our de jure defensive territory that the wine prince’s have stolen from us to further secure the west lest it fall further."

A33_empire_rose_pluc_title: "The Withered Rose"
A33_empire_rose_pluc_desc: "The Lorentish kings will always see the empire as an existential threat and scheme and war to struggle against us. For there to be peace in the west we must seek to ally ourselves with their vassals and the fearful Winebay states. Dismantling Lorent will not have been the desired outcome though they will have forced it on us with their distrust."

A33_empire_dece_util_title: "A Federal Model"
A33_empire_dece_util_desc: "The uplifting of the imperial parliament an our efforts in creating grand duchies have helped evolve the empire into a cooperative and united state. We must finalize these reforms and finally enshrine a federalism into the empire so that it may bear its namesake forever, “Anbennar”."

A33_empire_alenic_title: "Gawedi Rivalry"
A33_empire_alenic_desc: "Of all the states surrounding the empire the most belligerent are the Gawedi are the most belligerent seeking the city of Vertesk as their prize. We must help reclaim the hinterland around Vertesk to properly shunt the ambitions of the Gawed."

A33_empire_anbennar_alenic_title: "The Dove Over The Eagle"
A33_empire_anbennar_alenic_desc: "The eagle has loomed viciously over Anbennar since time immemorial with all the nastiness and malice that they can conjure. Today however we will now make an example of the triumph of a benevolent and peaceful temperament over the greedy violent despots of Halann. The success of the dove over the eagle shall be remembered by all people as a triumph worthy of the times."

A33_influence_vernman_title: "Seniority Over the Vernman"
A33_influence_vernman_desc: "The dissolution of Dameria at the end of the lilac wars has left many small Vernmen statelets and entities within the empire. As the largest Vernmen state absorption of these counties seems natural though it would likely be fiercely resisted by them in the battlefield and imperial court. An alternative proposal however would be to attempt to use our seniority to apply some soft power and reforge their obligations to us instead of Dameria a proposal slightly less taxing on their trust. "
