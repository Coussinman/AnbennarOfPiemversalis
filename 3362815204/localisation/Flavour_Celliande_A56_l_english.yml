flavor_celliande.1.t: "Establishment of The Serondor Order"
flavor_celliande.1.d: "The Divenhal Sea has long been plagued by piracy, whether from the scoundrels of Nathalaire or the monstrous sea-dogs of Viakkoc. In response, a rising star of Sorncell, the knight Sorondor, has founded a new kind of order—one that rides the waves instead of the land. His knights patrol the sea with vigilance, striking down pirates before they can threaten trade or peace. Now, with Nathalaire pacified and under our control, we have the perfect opportunity to transform this den of lawlessness into the proud headquarters of the Order, a bastion of justice in the Divenhal."
flavor_celliande.1.a: "They will be of great use in our navy"
flavor_celliande.1.b: "The Order shall protect the seas while we focus on the land"
flavor_celliande.1.c: "I wonder what the future holds for them"

flavor_celliande.2.t: "The Partition of Sugamber"
flavor_celliande.2.d: "The barbarians of Sugamber may have triumphed during the Lilac Wars, seizing lands that rightfully belonged to us and the Moon Party—but they have made many enemies. Among them are their Wexonard kin in Bisan, who too suffered at their hands. This shared grievance opens the door for cooperation. If we strike together, coordinating a two-pronged assault, we can crush Sugamber and divide their lands between us—reclaiming what was once ours, and seizing even more in the process."
flavor_celliande.2.a: "Today we are allies"
flavor_celliande.2.b: "The eagle flies alone"

flavor_celliande.3.t: "Revenge best served cold"
flavor_celliande.3.d: "Ewald II of Sugamber has led his armies personally against us, and has sadly bested us. But now is the time for revenge, Ewald is old and without an heir. Striking him down now will not only take revenge for the damage he caused us, but will bring chaos to Sugamber."
flavor_celliande.3.a: "Ewald will die bleeding and alone"

flavor_celliande.4.t: "Underground Slavery of Nathalaire"
flavor_celliande.4.d: "It is no secret that the scoundrels of Nathalaire raid coastal villages and kidnap their inhabitants, just to sell them as slaves in the black markets of the city. Tales of old Milcorissia tell that slavery was a common practice, and that the slaves were treated well. If we are to emulate the ways of Milcorissia as its true heirs, we should think about keeping this practice."
flavor_celliande.4.a: "Slavery must continue, just like in the old days of Milcorissia"
flavor_celliande.4.b: "Set the peasants to work, they shall pay taxes"

flavor_celliande.5.t: "Serondor síl Sorncell"
flavor_celliande.5.d: "A Promising Knight from Sorncell, Sorondor has been fighting against the pirates of the Divenhal sea with his crew of knights. He has been sucessful in his endeavors, and now he has come to us to offer his services in our navy."

flavor_celliande.6.t: "The Rebellion of Varlosen"
flavor_celliande.6.d: "The Time has come, the Milcori nationalists of Varlosen are ready to rise up against the tyranny of the marquisate of Arannen, and they have called upon us to support them. We must not let this opportunity pass, we must support them and bring The Borders under the rightful rule of Milcorissia."
flavor_celliande.6.a: "Milcorissia will rise again!"

flavor_celliande.7.t: "The Rebellion of Varlosen"
flavor_celliande.7.d: "A shadowy organization called Lodge of the Nameless has over the decades taken prominence in the Tower of Varlosen and turned it into a den for research on the ancient magic of Milcorissia.\nWhile the marquisate of Arannen has tolerated them in exchange for their support, they have recently started to grow restless and demand control of more land on the grounds of furthering their research objectives by exploring Milcorissian labyrinths.\nLocal nobles have refused to grant them access to said land and in response the lodge has started to stir up unrest in the region, gathering under them nobles of alleged Milcori origins as well as hedge-mages.\nWith these new supporters, they have grown bolder and decide to to start an uprising, seeking to take over the the region of the eastern borders and even calling themselves the true heirs of Milcorissia."
flavor_celliande.7.a: "Milcorissia will rise again!"

flavor_celliande.8.t: "Lodge of the Nameless"
flavor_celliande.8.d: "With Varlosen liberated, an invitation arrived—an audience with the elusive Lodge of the Nameless. In the shadow of the Tower, their leaders revealed ancient truths: they had uncovered the Labyrinth buried beneath Varlosen and, through arcane rites, made contact with Xamarzu, the last King of Milcorissia—still alive through sorcery and time.\n\nThey speak of fate and of destiny long delayed. According to them, we have been chosen to restore the fallen kingdom of Milcorissia. The Lodge believes our dynasty is destined to rise, to claim triumph over the shattered remnants of The Borders, and to shape the future that was stolen from Xamarzu."
flavor_celliande.8.a: "We are the true heirs of Milcorissia!"

flavor_celliande.9.t: "Toarnese Delusions"
flavor_celliande.9.d: "The Toarnese deny their Milcori heritage, and instead think themselves to be Lorentish. They think that they are above us, and that we are nothing but peasants. Now that they have been subjugated, we have to decide how to deal with them. "
flavor_celliande.9.a: "These Fanatics have no place here"
flavor_celliande.9.b: "Leave them to their delusions"

flavor_celliande.10.t: "The Approach"
flavor_celliande.10.d: "While during his duties, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was approached by one of our court mages, claiming to be a member of an secretive organization seeking to restore the glory of Milcorissia. He claims that if we want their support, we should aid the Tower of Varlosen in their endeavors in gaining independence from the marquisate of Arannen. The mage claims that the Tower is the key to restoring Milcorissia, and that we should support them in their endeavors."
flavor_celliande.10.a: "We will do our duty"

flavor_celliande.11.t: "Increased pro Celliander sentiment in Corseton"
flavor_celliande.11.d: "The Neratic Temple of Corseton has grown in influence, drawing in a wave of new clergy and fervent followers. These voices, increasingly bold, have begun to speak openly about their dissatisfaction with Bisanese rule—claiming the temple suffers under their oversight. Instead, they argue, the temple would flourish under Celliander rule, whose devotion to Nerat aligns more closely with their own. Whispers of dissent are spreading like embers on dry wind."
flavor_celliande.11.a: "Everyday more of the Clergy make their stance known."

flavor_celliande.12.t: "Political Disagreements"
flavor_celliande.12.d: "Bisan has dispatched envoys to Sorncell, hurling accusations that we are the ones stoking unrest in Corseton. They claim we aim to destabilize their control of the Neratic Temple and seize it for ourselves. And while their words drip with outrage, they are not mistaken. Corseton is more than just a city—it is a sacred Milcori site, and as the rightful heirs of Milcorissia, it must be under our protection. The temple belongs with those who truly understand its legacy."
flavor_celliande.12.a: "Corseton is rightfully ours!"

flavor_celliande.13.t: "Rise up sons of Milcorissia!"
flavor_celliande.13.d: "With the unrest in Corseton overflowing, the Neratic Temple has declared itself independent from Bisanese rule and called upon us to support and pacify Bisan."
