flavor_dasmatus.1.desc: "We Maqeti have walked to the very limit of death, and we know its thresholds well.\n\nFourteen years ago, in a lightning raid which swept our navy from beneath us, Dasmazar fell. Mere weeks undid the work of centuries. Ceding the island of Subkaliss to Sarkashabid in exchange for a relief fleet, the tattered remnants of our army fled to the island of Dasmatuš with the holy bloodline of our prophet Maqet, salvaging a life from the wreckage. Here we sit, a decade and a half later, gazing across the water in fury and grief.\n\nWe call this cataclysmic event the Halkhut. We estimate that over a third of our people are dead. A further number impossible to count have been scattered to the winds by the vagaries of gnollish whim, now left at the mercy of slavery’s horrific shopkeeper logic. Even in the city of our so-called allies, enslaved Maqeti are sold.\n\nAnd yet, we Maqeti have known both slavery and liberation before. To know Surakel is to know that the candle’s flame appears ever threatened by the buffeting wind. An inferno is building that will sweep across the Gulf of Rahen, a red wreath upon the very waves themselves. From the tiniest light, like Surakel we will return."

And we will be swept under by his bloody tide. A decade ago we fled here, to the tomb of Dasma, with the remnants of our army, and of our population. We saw them as separate, but they were not. Are not. For centuries, we have made that mistake. Even Maqet could not accept that there is no difference between a soldier and a civilian. Everyone is a soldier. Everyone can fight. And today, if we are to have a chance to make it through the coming storm, we will need every man, woman and child we have left. Today, we have no room for the future. We sacrifice the future so that some of us may live to see it. Even our sons will fight. Childhood is a luxury we cannot afford."

You know better than any that I am a better strategist. Let me lead, not just in spirit, but in name. The people need to know that I have the authority. No man would think you weak. they all know that you have bled as much a any other. they know that you hurt too, even if you do not wear your scars on the outside. none would call you a coward. Rather, they would know you to not just be brave, but wise. to be the king who has delivered us through the night; through our darkest days. Step down, Father. Please.” \nIdras sighs, and speaks. “You are right, my son...”"

Even Rahen faces dark tidings, as a wave of evil from the mountains threatens to wash them away in a tide of blood. Their kingdoms return to ruin. There is no hope, no salvation to be found; there is no one to save us. As we ever have, we endure, but now the Dark comes for us - and there is no one left to fight for us. Surakel fades.

Maqet stood alone against the gnolls, spitting in the face of certain doom, speaking defiance, even when none came to his aid. We stood alone against the gnolls for 4 centuries, for Jaher's promised aid was never to come. We stood defiant, even as gnolls overran our lands, all those decades ago. We did not give up. We did not lose hope. We. Kept. Fighting. Enduring. For that is who we are. Aqtara still burns! Its light has not gone out. We are the Maqeti!

To take a couple of swipes at the overseer before her head was crushed against the wall, maybe. To die proud.\n\nThe thought hangs in her, even as the Maqeti soldiers - her soldiers - rush in. She watches distantly as they strike off the chains with great hammers. She has been in this dank place for weeks now, a punishment for a disobedience she barely even remembers. There is a man in front of her, with long Maqeti eyelashes, and he is being so gentle and hesitant with her that she feels a lump in her throat.\n\n“The islanders are here,” he says, and his grin is the most beautiful thing she has ever seen. “We’re going to kill every gnoll we can find.”"

Ten years later, Dasma led us east, for the gnolls reminded us that we were no more invincible than they. We fled here, and we never looked back. We built a home here, in Dasmazar, and we thought that we had found freedom- that we had found peace. We were wrong. Only a few centuries later, our hated enemies came to us, driven east on the back of the arrival of the Elves. The elves came, and they destroyed our peace. Jaher pledged aid, if we would but lend him a few ships. We never once saw his armies after that. Alone we fought against the gnolls, and alone we fell. For centuries more we held, but it did not last. Only a few decades past, we nearly lost everything. The beasts came down like a storm, and we broke before them. We survived only by dealing with the only ones we hate more than those hyenas- slavers. We sold the people of Subkaliss for a pittance of relief. A few ships carrying refugees to the tomb of Dasma himself. That was all that remained. Maybe thirty thousand escaped. A fraction of what we were. We were not even a shadow of what we had been, but we did not despair- we could not afford to. We did not give up, for we were the last hope for those in chains, and we would not surrender. We would not fall. And we did not. From the moment we fled, we began making plans. We rallied the survivors, and rebuilt our fleets. We reminded our chained kin that it was not over yet. And when we struck back, we fought with a strength that only a freedman can know. We bled for this victory, for this moment, but it is here. We are no longer merely Dasmatuš - though our long exile has made it home. No, we are Dasmazar once again. Dasma’s legacy is ours once more. The sons of Maqet still remain."

flavor_dasmatus.32.t: "Abolition Enforced"
flavor_dasmatus.32.desc: "With the solidification of Dasmati control over another warren of slavery, the new authorities have set about breaking up the markets and executing those few flesh traders who still remain. Local buildings have been commandeered as Family Offices, and the estates of slavers have been seized for use as temporary synods. Prosecutions of slave owners will begin in a few weeks, after the Offices have taken the testimony of the local freedmen; exoneration is not in question, but the degree of punishment can differ greatly depending on the testimony of the freedmen. \n\nIt will take time to retool the economy away from the trade of souls, but such efforts are necessary to spread the light of Surakel."

flavor_dasmatus.33.t: "Stalk the Claw"
flavor_dasmatus.33.desc: "Never in all of our history, even before the Halkhut, has a Dasmati army marched so far west. Such a thing would be impossible without our gnollish clients in Haraagtseda, who know this kind of terrain even when they are not personally familiar with the region. Our mystics have always preached that the light of Surakel is immanent in all things, including gnolls, but this has been truly difficult to believe of these quarrelsome and combative beasts. It must be said that even in their conversion, we still expected treachery, apostasy, the reemergence of the malevolent dark.\n\nAnd yet, and yet - Krahilzin stands a smoking ruin, and such manoeuvres would have been impossible without our gnollish auxiliaries. They moved with unerring swiftness across the grand savannahs of Gol, harrying our enemies and keeping them off-balance as our slower main column arrived with siege. It is true that there is little love lost between the Fieldstalkers and the Sorrowclaws, who were divided by religion even before we converted Haraagtseda, but it is still truly something to see Surakel’s will delivered to the music of hyena calls. \n\nWe have annihilated this city. As one of the oldest entrepots of gnollish slavery, it deserves nothing but to be erased from memory. What sparse arable land exists here, we have salted. Almost none of the human freedmen here wish to remain, and have already begun their journey east; our Haraagtseda auxiliaries have formally adopted those gnollish young left alone after our purge. For the few who wish to stay, we have built a small outpost and hunting station several leagues from the former site of Krahilzin. The synodics accompanying our officer corps, after conferring for a few hours, have named the new settlement Kamusaqu Ašru: the place where chains are broken."

flavor_dasmatus.34.t: "Ending the Slaveport"
flavor_dasmatus.34.desc: "No city embodies the malevolent dark which has descended upon the Ofehibi like proud Dakmender. Its wealthy upper crust delighted in a ridiculous affectation of Raheni fashion, desperate for some stolen echo of golden Dhenijansar. The kings of this land sold their very people, until a vicious cycle was created that could not be undone. No king who rejected slavery could raise wealth to rival that of a king who embraced the practice, and each coup in favour of the slave trade incurred further debts to the cities of the Harimraj, until eventually the Raheni stole the very land from under its people.\n\nLong familiar with failed uprisings, the slavers of Dakmender largely refused to leave the city, complacent in their mercenary brigades’ ability to fend off the rabble. The result was a great stadium of blood. In every household, men and women turned against their former owners. Rumours abounded; entire families were butchered by the freedmen, and it is even said that in one manor, a cook who had suffered under particularly cruel owners boiled them to death in a cauldron. We who knew the joy of catharsis in our own liberation could not deny it to the Ofehibi, who after all have suffered far longer than we.\n\nThe question remains; what route forward for Dakmender? We will not leave this place a smoking ruin - we owe a debt to the Ofehibi and to the freedmen here. The clay soil, relatively low rainfall and high coastal winds of the Keygas estuary have always encouraged saltbeds, but with investment and expansion, these could become a real basis for a freedman economy, benefiting from the same easy travel links which made it an entrepot for the flesh trade."
flavor_dasmatus.34.a: "Salt your food, not the earth"

flavor_dasmatus.35.t: "The Darkest Shadow"
flavor_dasmatus.35.desc: "Slavery is a product of the Malevolent Dark. Whereas Surakel represents all that is imminent, transcendent, and mystical, to conduct slavery is instead to debase the shard of light Surakel has placed in each of us, to assign it mere trade value. It is as if one grasped a shaft of sunlight and declared it worth no more than a certain weight of iron. Slavery eats at convenants both natural and lawful; it leads a brother to sell a brother, a parent to sell a child, an Akal to sell his people. \n\nIt is this crime which Simegasfan represents above all others. Here the Ofehibi sold their future to the base demands of flesh. It surprises us not a whit that this was also the centre of Mengi shadow worship, the first place to fall to the whispers of the night. They had lost their reverence for life long before that point. \n\nThe troops who took the city were disproportionately Ofehibi, themselves liberated from fetters in our previous raids. They were eager to ransack this place, to bring ruin to the capital of Ofehibi slavery forever. This wider region is known for gorgeous perfumes and oils, such as those we use in our meditations to Surakel. The idea that such a place might one day supply the temples has fired the imagination of our freedmen, and we have already begun clearing ground for large orchards of the weeping trees."
flavor_dasmatus.35.a: "Banish the Dark!"

flavor_dasmatus.36.t: "How Freedom Gleams"
flavor_dasmatus.36.desc: "The traders of the gulf had no fear for their most easterly port. Our campaign, when it began, focused mostly on the Ofehibi, our neighbours and friends, and even we held little hope of extending abolition so far beyond our home waters. Thus does Surakel make naysayers of even his most ardent devotees. The estuary of the Yet is not unlike the port at Dakmender, and indeed our abolition efforts along the northern coast have driven trade towards this stately harbour. No longer.\n\nThe city of Yetmesira fell to heavy coastal bombardment, and the now customary amnesty broke the back of any local resistance. The sheer number of enslaved people gathered here has leant us unusual manpower and vigour. Though the Yeteferen slavers largely fled upriver during the siege, we have tried and executed every Raheni trader we have found. There is no hesitation about which trade will replace slavery here - the wealthy Raheni merchant with the gleaming jewels of the Yet on his fat fingers is an image every freedman in Yetmesira has burned into their psyche. \n\nMany of the freedmen here are skilled in gemcutting and delicate mouldwork, and we have already begun to organise them into commercial synods. The beauty they create will be theirs to dispense with as they will."
flavor_dasmatus.36.a: "Hope Glitters"

flavor_dasmatus.37.t: "Never On Human Neck A Harpy Yoke"
flavor_dasmatus.37.desc: "Like vultures descending on the battlefield, the harpies of Naléni have picked at the bones of the Ofehibi, casting a steady flow of souls north into the slavering maw of the Kharunyana estuary. Stopping only to reserve the choicest morsels for their depraved harems, these pirates display an unnerving adaptability in their pursuit of personal comfort. No more. Here more than in other places the slavers escaped justice, flying off across the Gulf or taking ship before we could institute a total blockade. Yet revenge, though sweet, is not our primary object here.\n\nFurther inland, as the Emot Nepas Sedar rises to a great height, we have found lands reminiscent of our own, where the key conditions needed for coffee cultivation may be met. Having levelled Masphíre and outlawed the trading of flesh, we are in need of a replacement industry to grant the people here wealth and economic independence. Surveyors have already headed into the mountains and a mass expropriation of slaver land has begun. These territories are singularly disorganised, but the steady hand of the synod and the work of reunification will restore a country of the Ofehibi here once more."
