#INDLEBURY
INDL_1_1_title: "Undoing the Great Fire"
INDL_1_1_desc: "Decades after the Great Fire, Indlebury is still in shambles. Our people worked hard and endured too much, but the damage dealt to the city by the power of wicked flames was too great to be able to restore the city properly. Even now, a wandering sight could still discover the consequences of the Great Fire — a burned carcass of what once was a grain silo here, a destroyed livestock pen there. But there is a silver lining in the clouds surrounding Indlebury. Halfling folk, living in the Indlebury possibly longer than any records of this place even exist, were busy even since the Great Fire. The number of halflings arriving had gradually increased over the course of years, mostly from the small Esmarian duchy of Deamóine, and every arriving family had been taking its part in the restoration process."
INDL_1_2_title: "Restore the Old Bury"
INDL_1_2_desc: "The Old Bury, remainings of a great Damerian fort that used to command the patch of lands along the Cotumer before the city of Indlebury came to existence, was not spared by the Great Fire. Serving as a city hall for centuries, it suffered a terrible damage the most. The magnificent Old Bury was a pride of every Indleburyman, and seeing it in disrepair is a great tragedy for every citizen. Luckily, one thing that Indlebury never lacked is mercenaries. All sorts of Wexonard swords for hire fighting in foreign lands participated in many great numbers of castle sieges, and with the expertise of such seasoned veterans we will be able to restore The Old Bury to its full grandeur."
INDL_1_3_title: "Local Delicacies"
INDL_1_3_desc: "Recently, our local delicacy have made Indlebury quite famous within the Empire. The halflings of Indlebury, especially in the rural hinterland far from the Cotumer river, tend to be pig farmers. And one of their most profitable traditions is to use a special bred sort of pigs for hunting the expensive fungi in the forests of Ottocam. Truffles of Indlebury, thanks to our halfling friends, have not only made Indlebury quite famous, but also make up the majority of high-valuable goods exported to the foreign markets. A halfling farmer and a human warrior protecting his farm are making lots of money together in Indlebury."
INDL_1_4_title: "Our Cousins"
INDL_1_4_desc: "Magdalaire, the 'Anbenncost of The Borders', is, perhaps, the grandest metropolis existing within the Wexonard borders. A melting pot of different cultures and beliefs, the upper class of Magdalairey society stands united by their faith in Nerat and reverence of their Lady-Founder, the greatest female Wexonard warrior. We are quite different, we may not always agree with each others, but we are cousins. Together we are more than just a sum of two cities."
INDL_2_1_title: "The Riverstone Clan"
INDL_2_1_desc: "The dwarves of Riverstone Clan from Menibór are famous for being the city's primary architects and engineers. Originating as stone masons during the age of Damerian duchy, they gained their fame through construction and maintenance of magnificent stone bridges crossing the Luna river in multiple places, connecting multiple parts of the city together.\n\nAs our city recovers from the Great Fire, the need in qualified builders is high as ever. The old bridges leading to the other side of Cotumer river are in disrepair or completely destroyed by the fires. Reaching out to Menibór dwarves would be a smart move."
INDL_2_2_title: "Small Folk, Great Deeds"
INDL_2_2_desc: "Liberation of Bisanese Corridor had brought freedom to the great number of halfling populace, remnants of the ancient Oakfoot Halfling identity, inhabiting The Borders since the times immemorial. These people had suffered a great tragedy during the War of Sorceror-King, when the acolytes of Nichmer and their hordes of undead initiated mass halfling purge all over Escann and The Borders. The remnants of halfling in The Borders have settled in Wexonard lands along the Cotumer river and Bisanese Corridor, finding a safe refuge from the oncoming slaughter. Under our guidance, the halfling people will suffer no more, for it is our duty to take the responsibility and protect the 'Small Country of the East' in return for everything good halflings did for us."
INDL_3_4_title: "The Righteous Cause"
INDL_3_4_desc: "Fires of war have been rekindled once again in Anbennar. But Indlebury does not stand alone. Many dwarves and halflings have rallied to protect our shared cause, and many more dwarves and halflings abroad are prepared to do the same for their kin in the times of need. It is said that dwarvens had forgotten the art of siege warfare more than humans ever knew, and there is nothing more dangerous than a halfling farmers whose farm is under a threat. Wexonard dukes simply have no idea what they are messing with."
INDL_3_5_title: "Bask in Glory"
INDL_3_5_desc: "Petty dukes were no match for a combined effort of the Imperial Free Cities and Electors. Some of the nobles pledged their allegiance to us, some of the ruling families fled to foreign courts. Without a doubt, they will try to take back their thrones. But for now, the day is ours. The dream of Wexonard League is finally coming to fruition. Our lands shall no longer be plagued by internal strife!"
INDL_4_1_title: "Indel's Legacy"
INDL_4_1_desc: "Every city or a small town in the Empire has some sort of a founding myth or a story, but no other city has so much fervor in discussing their origins as Indlebury. The legend of the mysterious saviour, liberating the small town from a gang terrorizing it has become a central part in the identities of citizens of Indlebury. The discussions about Indel's identity is almost a daily occurence on the city square, and as Indlebury keeps expanding, it seems like every citizen has his own version of events happened back in the past, when Indlebury was not even named Indlebury. As a [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], we are expected to voice our own opinion, as the tradition dictates. Every citizen is urging to know your opinion — who was Indel?"
INDL_5_1_title: "The Great Scare"
INDL_5_1_desc: "Following the Great Fire, the citizens of Indlebury, who could not exactly boast about their hospitality beforehand, became overly angry and suspicious. As the process of recovery went on, increased paranoia of Indleburymen led them to suspect everything in the world to cause fires — from their own families to halflings inhabiting the newly restored quarter near the Old Bury along the Cotumer river. While this display of distrust is mostly unwelcomed, it could serve its purpose, what if the real cause of the fire lies somewhere outside our borders? Who can guarantee the fires were not caused by some malicious will of the third party? This requires a proper investigation."
INDL_5_2_title: "Peace Through War"
INDL_5_2_desc: "The time is nigh — citizens of Indlebury are ready to march beyond our borders in the pursuit of the truth, emboldened by their rising suspicions. The city is abuzz like a nest of hornets, and we know exactly what we are doing: we are merely directing the hornets to their goal instead of letting the hornets to sting themselves. The relentless vigour of our overly suspicious compatriots eventually will unveil a true conspirator behind the flames, uncovering everything, sparing none."
INDL_5_3_title: "Triumph of the Suspicious"
INDL_5_3_desc: "As the time went on, the original goal of the Great Scare, initiated by the upper class of Indlebury to channel the energy of its fanatic citizens looking for the perpetrator behind the Great Fire, was forgotten. The search for the people to blame turned into cultural exchange in the conquered capitals, countless sieges led to the development of military theory and engineering capable of building new fortifications in our own lands. This is an unexpected result, but it is the most welcome one."

#MAGDALAIRE
MAGD_1_1_title: "Children of Celarion"
MAGD_1_1_desc: "Magdalaire is one of the most diverse cities of The Borders, and there is a good reason for that. Back in the times of the war against the despicable Sorceror-King, the founder of our city, a brave Wexonard female warrior, our dear Lady Magda, fought against the countless hordes of undead with her allies from all around Free Realms. One of them, a Moon Elf called Celarion, fought so selflessly, he eventually won the greatest prize of this war — the heart of our Lady Magda, thus Beginning the long-standing tradition of elvenizing Wexonard people of Magdalaire. Up to this day, their half-elven descendants make up a notable upper class of the city, and every day we strive to make Magdalaire a place that every elf can call a home."
MAGD_1_2_title: "Our Cousins"
MAGD_1_2_desc: "Indlebury, bearing the title 'Smallest City of the East', had its share of unfortunate events recently. The great fire, which destroyed nearly a half of the city, will long be remembered by the survivors with fear and anger. But they do not have to bear this burden alone. Let it be known that their cousins from the free city of Magdalaire came to their help, when no one else did."
MAGD_2_1_title: "Our Metropolis"
MAGD_2_1_desc: "Magdalaire, initially founded by Lady Magda as a regimental town on the borders of controlled by Free Realms land in a war against Sorceror-King, had been growing far and wide ever since. When the horrors of the foul sorcery had dissipated, and the Empire of Anbennar was formed, Magdalaire found its place in a big family of united courts and cities. Forever upbeat and magnificent, the city stands tall, honouring its founder, and may it stand for a thousand years more!"
MAGD_2_2_title: "Delve into Classics"
MAGD_2_2_desc: "Four and a half centuries ago, elves found their way into Cannor, following the call of Dame leading them away from the clutch of higher powers that trapped them on seas without any hope and track of time. Elves are very long-lived species, but since their arrival, even their longest living individuals have started forgetting their roots, blending with numerous human cultures of Cannor. The outbreak of Lilac Wars was a major setback for the development of any culture, demanding more and more resources for neverending series of wars. With the dust finally settled, many scholars around Cannor turn their gaze back to the almost forgotten ancient elven culture. And with our special connection to elves, we are among the first cities to embrace the revival of their ancient wisdom."
MAGD_3_4_title: "Just Like the Old Times"
MAGD_3_4_desc: "Once again, the city of Magdalaire finds itself in a war that threatens to end its existence. Just like in the old times, elves and half-elves will heed the call of Celarion's children and rally to protect the last standing bastion of freedom in The Borders."
MAGD_3_5_title: "Paradise Found"
MAGD_3_5_desc: "Petty dukes were no match for a combined effort of the Imperial Free Cities and Electors. Some of the nobles pledged their allegiance to us, some of the ruling families fled to foreign courts. Without a doubt, they will try to take back their thrones. But for now, the day is ours. The dream of Wexonard League is finally coming to fruition. Our lands shall no longer be plagued by internal strife!"
MAGD_4_1_title: "Honour Our Namesake"
MAGD_4_1_desc: "Every Castanmark, all honest citizens of Magdalaire gather to honour the Lady-Founder. The large festival was always hosted, attracting numerous merchants from every corner of Cannor and gathering people of all races and backgrounds with a purpose of honouring the fallen, rejoicing over the great victory of Free Realms, and, most importantly, cherishing our beloved Lady Magda.\n\nInterrupted by the outbreak of Fourth Lilac Wars, this tradition is finally coming back to light, supported by the upper classes of Magdalaire as a tool of building bridges between us and other countries in these times of trouble."
MAGD_4_2_title: "Glassweaving Masters"
MAGD_4_2_desc: "Some of the few elves who chose to settle in Wexonard lands have found their home in Aelthil. The elven artisans of Aelthil are famous far and wide beyond the borders of Anbennar for their masterful art of glassweaving, crafting the truly mesmerizing product which sought in every court of the known world. Although the craftsmen of Aelthil live in isolation, as it takes centuries to fully grasp every aspect of their art, their ties with the outside world had never been severed. Our long-standing ties with the elven kind demand us to fully support the glassweaving guilds of Aelthil, so they could practice their art in peace and bring us fame and fortune."
MAGD_5_1_title: "Jailor's Champions"
MAGD_5_1_desc: "Since the glorious victory over Nichmer and his underlings, real liberators of The Borders were forgotten. People do not have much faith in Neratic clergy, and the clergy itself saw better times. Varying from total indifference in some countries and being in constant clashes with rulers' courts in others, Neratic clergy clings to the High Hall of Judgement, a symbol of the ultimate victory of Nerat against the necromantic defilement, in a desperate attempt to overcome the ignorance of rulers.\n\nBut we, people of Magdalaire, know different. The story of our people is one of vigilant service to Nerat. Our Lady-Founder was one of the most noteworthy champions of Nerat, delivering his sentence to vile sorcerors, plaguing these lands. We share our destiny with Neratic clerics."
MAGD_5_2_title: "Land of Nerat"
MAGD_5_2_desc: "Our liberation of Wexonard lands is in progress. Lands, once known for their desolation, now ruled by the forces of progress, bringing actual purpose into the lives of many Wexonard people, regardless of their background and wealth. Every little village sparkles with life and vitality under the watchful eye of Neratic clergy, sprawling all across the Borders with a newfound vigour thanks to our efforts. Countless new places of worship are being constructed, and the even the land itself starts brimming with vitality, as if Nerat himself approves of our efforts and is rewarding his humble servants."
MAGD_5_3_title: "Grand Cathedral"
MAGD_5_3_desc: "We have kept our promise. Neratic clergy, once on a brink of shrinking to insignificance, are now making a major comeback, and its influence over Wexonard lands have never been stronger in centuries. This massive effort is worth the grandest of celebrations! A massive cathedral shall be constructed in Magdalaire to commemorate our past, present and future service to Nerat, and the whole of Cannor will bear witness to it. Send all kinds of delegations and invite every priest of every god from every temple, if needed, because from now on, no one will question our allegiance to the faith ever again!"
MAGD_5_4_title: "Keepers of the Necropolis"
MAGD_5_4_desc: "Across the river Cotumer from Corseton rises a bone-white limestone cliff, with the Neratic Necropolis on top of it — a heart of Neratic faith, a sprawling complex of crypts, temples and ossuaries, stretching for miles under the cliff face and into the surrounding lands. But that is not what the Necropolis truly is. The network of catacombs, the labyrinth, the impossible maze? An enigma of such a scale that it would take millenia of human life to even chart the map of the upper levels of the labyrinth. The well-hidden truth is, not even the Neratic priesthood was able pierce the veil of mystery, surrounding the crypts of ancient Milcorissian heritage, in centuries. Deep within the seat of Nerat's council, ancient corseted corpses lie in their sarcophagi, waiting patiently for the right moment to strike back. The impossible evil lies at the very heart of our faith. The clergy needs us just as much as we need them. If the time comes- when the time comes, we will be ready. We stopped the defilement once before, it would be a honor to do so again."

#PRE-WL COMMON MISSIONS
WL_3_1_title: "Encroaching Lion"
WL_3_1_desc: "Dawn of the Lilac Wars and the triumph of the Rose Party saw the rise of Lothane III sil Wex as the emperor of Anbennar. However, not every Wexonard duchy fought for the Lorent. Duke of Bisan, taking pride in his connections with the remnant Damerian duchies, had his eyes set on our Free Cities for a long time. This threat cannot be ignored, and two Wexonard Free Cities will unite against it."
WL_3_2_title: "Alliance of Towns"
WL_3_2_desc: "With the united effort of two Free Cities, the numerous towns and villages of the Bisanese Corridor were relieved of the ambitions of yet another duke who promised them nothing but pointless sacrifices in his name. With them under our control, what shall be our course of action?"
WL_3_3_title: "Curtailing the Warmongers"
WL_3_3_desc: "Unfortunately, our little federation will not be allowed to simply exist in peace. Our status as a Free City protects us from the outright direct invasion from both Wex and Sugamber, but sure as hell, they will try everything to stomp out the flames of our freedom. It seems like we have no other choice but to reach out for the support from other courts and cities. The Empire, who granted us our status of the Free Cities, shall help us again."
WL_4_2_title: "Our Roots"
WL_4_2_desc: "A rich history of Wexonard people started with a disaster that nearly ended with the extinction of our kind, but that is a tale everyone knows too well. Forced to leave the pastoral plains of Alenic Expanse by the advancement of Gawedi tribes, our people ended up settling in Wexhills, a focal point that gave birth to our history. Today, with the liberation of towns and villages of the former Duchy of Wex, we open a new page in this history. We became one step closer to fulfilling our dream of a future where no Wexonard man will die in vain."
WL_2_2_title: "In the Amber Hall"
WL_2_2_desc: "Sugamber, a duchy built upon the countless ruins of the past civilizations, had suffered a great upheaval during the succession crisis after the old duke Ewald II legitimized his bastard daughter, young Lisolette, as a direct heir for the duchy. This decision had sparked outrage amongst many nobles, who rallied around the duke's cousin, Ethelbert, plunging the duchy into a bloody succession war. Without our direct intervention, how long the flames of this conflict would smolder, poisoning the hearts and souls of every Wexonard person?"

#WL MISSIONS

The construction will not be easy, a lot of expenses are expected, but what are few crowns worth when the future of our own country is at stake?"

The Bisanese Corridor, a vital strategic link between West Dameshead and The Borders, is in our hands and countless villages and towns, previously forced to toil for the fruitless ambitions of the Bisanese Dukes, now await the promised changes with breathless anticipation.

The Festival of Lady-Founder is a time of celebration, defiance, and renewal, when the city shines brightest, remembering her greatest deeds and horrors all free people had to withstand under the thumb of Witch-King and his Acolytes. As always, the right of closing speech belongs to [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]. The right words come to mind instantly, the following truths are known to every citizen of Magdalaire."

The legend of the mysterious saviour, liberating the small town from a gang terrorizing it has become a central part in the identities of citizens of Indlebury. The discussions about Indel's identity is almost a daily occurence on the city square, and as Indlebury keeps expanding, it seems like every citizen has his own version of events happened back in the past, when Indlebury was not even named Indlebury. As a [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], we are expected to voice our own opinion, as the tradition dictates. Every citizen is urging to know your opinion — who was Indel?"

After successfully surviving the great rebellion of old Wexonard nobility and building a system of checks and balances between various branches of the government and different centers of influence, Wexonard League stands as a cell of the order in the Empire, ready to face any challenge."

Sextarchy is a system of headhunting and training the most suitable government officials to solve any task League may face these days. After serving an initial three-year term representing their home city, government officials are faced with the choice whether to continue their career development by serving another three-year term in one of the other five main cities of the League or stay loyal to their home area. This can be followed by serving in every main city, should they wish to do so. Those who demonstrate consistent excellence in their service to the League over a span of eighteen years across six primary cities are regarded as highly qualified candidates for the position of president."
