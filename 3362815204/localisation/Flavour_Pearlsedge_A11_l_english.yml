 A11_wine_classic_title:0 "Wine, Classic"
 A11_wine_classic_desc:0 "Ah, Pearl Vintage. One of the most popular white wines, excellent with seafood of all kinds and appreciated by many for its light and dry taste. By establishing new production facilities, we can produce more of this wine - and, with its rising popularity, we will surely profit."
 A11_wine_modern_title:0 "Wine, Contemporary"
 A11_wine_modern_desc:0 "With a younger but no less impressive record than its sister wine, Pearl Modern is also quite profitable. Known for its sweet, vanilla-like aroma, Pearl Modern is frequently paired with fruit and citrus based desserts. With the introduction of a new production facility, we can increase how much of this wine we provide to our thirsty customers."
 A11_wine_perfect_title:0 "Wine, Perfected"
 A11_wine_perfect_desc:0 "In a bizarre event, one of our vintners forgot about one of his vineyards! While it laid forgotten, it rained quite heavily over this vineyard and his grapes were afflicted with an unfamiliar grey rot. Peculiarly, he then made wine with these grapes anyway! Even more bizarrely, this wine has been excellently received! It appears the rot dries out the grapes but leaves them otherwise intact, concentrating their sugars and producing an exquisitely sweet wine. While we will need more samples to study, this offers an excellent opportunity for us to enhance our sweet wines and perhaps even outcompete the venerable Jaherian Sunlight dessert wine. We will tell no one why these vintages are particularly sweet, of course."
 A11_dominate_eordand_title:0 "Dominate Eordand"
 A11_dominate_eordand_desc:0 "To the west, the land of Eordand is rich in artifacts from the old elven empire that the local inhabitants clearly cannot properly utilize. If we were to establish control over the trade in these artifacts, we could make quite the tidy profit selling the odder ones to enthusiastic nobles and providing the more viable designs to our own manufacturers."
 A11_siloriel_friends_title:0 "Siloriel-Trísfer Friendship"
 A11_siloriel_friends_desc:0 "During the Lilac Wars, we aligned with House Siloriel of the Kingdom of Lorent against our supposed sovereigns, the House of Silmuna, Grand Dukes of Dameria and Emperors of Anbennar - in truth, little more than oppressors who corrupted the Empire into little more than an extension of their Grand Duchy. With the Grand Duchy of Dameria destroyed in the Lilac Wars, we have an unprecedented opportunity for imperial influence, and it is all thanks to our 'friends' in Lorent! We must truly make sure to repay them."
 A11_fall_of_tretun_title:0 "Fall of Tretun"
 A11_fall_of_tretun_desc:0 "The Duchy of Tretun is the rightful land of Pearlsedge, by right of conquest from our founder Henrik Divenscourge, just like the rest of the supposedly once-great Tretunic Kingdom. We must bring these glorified rebels under the aegis of our duchy and end this last, sad remnant of the Tretunic people."
 A11_conquest_of_roilsard_title:0 "Conquest of Roilsard"
 A11_conquest_of_roilsard_desc:0 "The Duchy of Roilsard is a failed state - they are truly like the thorns of their sigil, rising, falling, but always returning, something not even the Lorentish could ever get rid of. As its strongest neighbor, it is our duty to restore order and stability to its remains - and, additionally, acquire control over its profitable vineyards."
 A11_western_pearls_title:0 "West Pearls"
 A11_western_pearls_desc:0 "We have found an island chain to the far west well situated for control of future trade routes. We must establish a sufficient colony to control these islands, as we have heard great tales about the ancient treasures found further north and the great mineral wealth to their immediate south."
 A11_dominate_kheionai_title:0 "Dominate Kheionai"
 A11_dominate_kheionai_desc:0 "To the south of the West Pearls, the land of Kheionai is home to its own traders who deal in such things as cocoa, coffee and sugar. They are unlikely to be much of a competitor and if we seize control of this region's trade, we could supply such goods to our colonies on the cheap and attract more settlers."
 A11_nation_of_traders_title:0 "Nation of Traders"
 A11_nation_of_traders_desc:0 "We are a nation built by trade; from the beginning, Pearlsedge was born of Gerudian reavers conquering a land to settle down in and embrace trading over raiding. Since then, we have maintained a strong presence in any trade going in or out of the Dameshead, and are naturally placed to expand our trade routes even further in the future."
 A11_on_the_seas_title:0 "On the Seas"
 A11_on_the_seas_desc:0 "We must increase our presence on the seas to take advantage of how trade routes are rapidly shifting in the aftermath of the Lilac Wars and Greentide. New facilities should be built to train more of our people in sailing and navigation, so that they can ply the new trade routes that are sure to open up."
 A11_a_new_world_title:0 "A New, Yet Old, World"
 A11_a_new_world_desc:0 "While new trade routes were expected, we did not anticipate the rediscovery of the elven homeland. We must take an early lead in its exploration so we can get a proper slice of the pie, or else our rivals will claim the ancient treasures of this land instead."
 A11_new_breadbasket_title:0 "Breadbasket-to-be"
 A11_new_breadbasket_desc:0 "Far to our west is a large island akin to our own homeland, particularly the province of Erngrove, though much larger. It could provide the necessary food, timber, and other resources to fuel our future empire and so we shall claim it for ourselves."
 A11_central_pearls_title:0 "Central Pearls"
 A11_central_pearls_desc:0 "West of the great island we have taken to calling 'New Erngrove' lies a wide variety of lesser islands, placed perfectly between the two main continents. Any future trade will surely go through these islands and so we must make taking control of these islands our foremost goal!"
 A11_dominate_the_bay_title:0 "Dominate the Ruined Sea"
 A11_dominate_the_bay_desc:0 "With control over many of its islands, we are well on the way to dominate trade in the heart of Aelantir. We must complete our local dominance and make sure our traders are favored throughout the region."
 A11_pearl_white_army_title:0 "Pearl White Army"
 A11_pearl_white_army_desc:0 "With the fall of Dameria, the Dameshead has fallen into division between petty states. Only the persistence of the Empire of Anbennar has prevented total chaos. While dangerous, this also offers a chance to reclaim those lands that are rightfully ours - of course, doing so will require a suitable army."
 A11_claim_the_woods_title:0 "Claim the Woods"
 A11_claim_the_woods_desc:0 "The county of Woodwell is the obvious first target for our expansion. It is weak and forgettable, yet offers two resources we greatly desire: lumber and an excellent staging area for future expansion."
 A11_the_old_rivals_title:0 "The Old Rivals"
 A11_the_old_rivals_desc:0 "The Trísferian dynasty, and the House of Pearlman before them, have had two notable rivals throughout our history: the kings of Carneter and the mayors of Neckcliffe. With the fall of their protector, Dameria, we can finally conquer the remnants of these enemies. We shall consign the Kingdom of Carneter to the dustbin of history where it belongs and seize the city of Neckcliffe for ourselves."
 A11_wesdameric_ambitions_title:0 "Wesdameric Ambitions"
 A11_wesdameric_ambitions_desc:0 "Though they sided with us in the Lilac Wars, the rulers of Wesdam remain members of the House of Silmuna - particularly treacherous ones, at that. They will inevitably seek to restore Dameria and return us to subjugation! We must destroy them before they get the chance and consolidate our dominion over the Western Dameshead."
 A11_southern_pearls_title:0 "South Pearls"
 A11_southern_pearls_desc:0 "To our south, we have found yet another group of useful islands, as well as a nearby peninsula. It seems to have had very little native population before its discovery, and so could make for an excellent colony of ours - it is also quite close to the land of Taychend, an apparently wealthy land of warring kingdoms in need of some intervention by their betters."
 A11_dominate_taychend_title:0 "Dominate Taychend"
 A11_dominate_taychend_desc:0 "Perhaps the most valuable territory we have yet to find, Taychend is nevertheless a primarily non-coastal land - as such, it may be better for us to focus on controlling their trade with the rest of the world and make them a captive market rather than direct intervention. Or perhaps not, and we shall indeed take them for ourselves. Either way, extending our trade network to the region can only have benefits."
 A11_imperial_ambitions_title:0 "Imperial Ambitions"
 A11_imperial_ambitions_desc:0 "With the fall of the House Silmuna, our position as the defenders of the Dameshead places us as the obvious choice for a truly deserving emperor. We are far less decadent than the Damerians, reliant on magic as they are, we are far more virtuous than the degenerates of Esmaria, we are far more cultured than the primitive Arannese and the adventurer-spawned Arbarani, we are not Alenic savages like the Wexonards, and we have an ability to plan for the long-term quite lacking in the Damescrowners. We are sure there are some other peoples in the Empire, but they're too irrelevant to bother remembering. With such obviously inferior competition, our ascent to imperial glory is surely inevitable."
 A11_imperial_glory_title:0 "Imperial Glory"
 A11_imperial_glory_desc:0 "With many of the electors of the empire showing their intellect and now favoring our candidacy, the time has come to more aggressively court the rest. Only when we have taken the Dove Throne for ourselves, and find no challengers to our authority left standing, can we truly say we have saved the empire from its own inhabitants."
 A11_imperial_faith_title:0 "Imperial Faith"
 A11_imperial_faith_desc:0 "The rise of the Corinite heresy poses many problems for our authority in the Empire; many of the princes are too busy fighting each other over it to pause and recognize our superiority. We must crush this heresy without mercy - or, at least, bend it to our interests should eradication prove impossible."
 A11_imperial_unity_title:0 "Imperial Unity"
 A11_imperial_unity_desc:0 "With the empire united under our dynasty, the time has come to push our borders further. The Kingdoms of Lorent and Gawed have existed for long enough, holding their back from the future. We must crush these barbarian kingdoms and incorporate their lands into our most enlightened empire."
 A11_defenders_of_the_dameshead_mission_title:0 "Defenders of the Dameshead"
 A11_defenders_of_the_dameshead_mission_desc:0 "Since conquering this land, we have had a role in regulating what enters or exits the Dameshead. This role has become ever-more important, and ever-more difficult, with the emergence of the Aelantir to Cannor trade. If we are to continue, we must seize control of those islands in the Diven an enemy navy could use as mooring. Their current owners - the obnoxious Vernmen, weak Akasi, and peculiar elven reclamationists - are foolish and undeserving of such strategically valuable islands."
 A11_imperial_lencenor_title:0 "Safeguard Roilsard"
 A11_imperial_lencenor_desc:0 "One of our first acts as Emperor will be to secure the safety of Roilsard by bringing it fully under imperial control. The region remains vulnerable to the ambitions of the expansionist Kingdom of Lorent, which seeks to unite the Lencori under its rule. By annexing Roilsard, we not only strengthen our borders but also ensure the region’s stability and its integration into the imperial fold, safeguarding it from external threats."

 A11_pearly_bay_title:0 "Pearly Bay"
 A11_pearly_bay_desc:0 "Bay of Wines is a vital trade node in Cannor, being one of the richest trade nodes in Cannor. With it being under Pearlsedger control, we can ensure that the wealth of the region flows into our coffers, and that we can use it to further our own interests."

 A11_capital_title:0 "The Pearl Capital"
 A11_capital_desc:0 "The city of Pearlsedge is a sad sight to behold, a fishing town that was established by our Reaver ancestors. While serving as our capital, it is a far cry from the grandeur of the other imperial capitals. We will focus on developing Pearlsedge into a grand city, not falling behind the other electors in terms of splendor and wealth\n\nBy establishing some imperial connections, we will invite artisans and craftsmen from other imperial states to establish themselves in Pearlsedge, bringing their skills and expanding the cities production capabilities."

 A11_pearl_vintage_title:0 "Imperial Pearl Vintage"
 A11_pearl_vintage_desc:0 "Ah, Pearl Vintage. One of the most popular white wines, excellent with seafood of all kinds and appreciated by many for its light and dry taste. By establishing new production facilities, we can produce more of this wine - and, with its rising popularity, we will surely profit."

 A11_hills_title:0 "Exploting our Hills"
 A11_hills_desc:0 "The Tretunics, perched on the scenic hills of Tretunica, have long devoted themselves to fishing, overlooking the untapped potential of the rich resources their hills might hold. Their focus on the waters has left the bounties of their land unexplored, an opportunity waiting to be seized. "

 A11_reclaim_west_title:0 "Reclaim Imperial West"
 A11_reclaim_west_desc:0 "Rightful imperial land has fallen into the hands of foreign Lencori rulers, undermining the unity and authority of the Empire. As Emperor, it is our duty to reclaim these territories and restore them to their rightful place under imperial control."

 A11_lencori_question_title:0 "Lorentish Question"
 A11_lencori_question_desc:0 "For too long, the Empire of Anbennar has allowed its influence in Lencenor to wane, leaving a void that the Kingdom of Lorent has eagerly filled, cementing itself as the region's hegemon. This unchecked expansion threatens the balance of power and undermines imperial authority. The time has come to reverse this neglect and establish a formidable imperial presence in Lencenor."

 A11_lorent_image_title:0 "Lorent in our Image"
 A11_lorent_image_desc:0 "The time has come to take up the brush and paint the region of Lencenor in our image. Under the guidance of the Trisfer emperors, the future of Lencenor will be reshaped to align with our vision of unity and strength. Lorent, with its overreaching influence and unchecked ambition, will be the first to feel the bold brushstrokes of our will. Through conquest or diplomacy, we shall carve out a new order, one where the Empire's authority is unquestionable and its light shines brightest in Lencenor."

 A11_pearls_title:0 "Pearls"
 A11_pearls_desc:0 "The Pearls, the namesake of our nation, stand as a symbol of our prestige and legacy. This island, with its coasts abundant in valuable pearls, has long been the foundation of our wealth and renown. Yet, the potential of this resource remains only partially realized. By investing further into the pearl industry, we can expand its reach, enhance our trade networks, and secure an even greater share of the island's wealth. Let the world know that the finest pearls come from our shores."

 A11_jewels_title:0 "To Jewels"
 A11_jewels_desc:0 "The pearls harvested from our coasts are transported to Jewelpoint, a city renowned throughout the Empire for its masterful craftsmanship. Here, skilled dwarven artisans transform these treasures into exquisite jewelry, coveted by nobles from all corners of the realm. The demand for these elegant creations, made from the pearls of Pearlsedge, is consistently high, providing an excellent opportunity to strengthen both our economy and our influence within the Empire. By investing further in the local jewelry industry, we can not only ensure higher profits but also elevate our prestige as a center of refinement and wealth."

 A11_engrave_title:0 "Urbanize Erngrove"
 A11_engrave_desc:0 "The province of Engrove, currently a rural backwater, has the potential to become a bustling urban center. By investing heavily into the urbanization of Engrove and inviting skilled craftsmen and artisans from Jewelpoint to establish themselves in the city, we can transform it into a hub of commerce and industry that rivals the great cities of the Empire."

 A11_heartlands_title:0 "Pearly heartlands"
 A11_heartlands_desc:0 "A strong and stable heartland is the foundation upon which the prosperity and future of Pearlsedge must be built. By focusing on the development of our core territories, ensuring the welfare of our people, and strengthening our infrastructure, we can create a secure base for further expansion and influence. A thriving heartland will serve as the economic, cultural, and political backbone of our realm, enabling us to face any external challenges with confidence and unity."

 A11_behemoths_title:0 "Building Behemoths"
 A11_behemoths_desc:0 "To secure dominance over the seas, we must construct mighty warships that can withstand the fiercest storms and crush our enemies beneath their hulls.

 A11_imperial_ambitions_title:0 "Imperial Ambitions"
 A11_imperial_ambitions_desc:0 "With Dameria in ruins, the bonds that once held us to another's rule have been severed, granting us the freedom to chart our own path. The Empire teeters on the edge of uncertainty, with the Emperors of Wex losing the trust of the electors and the Imperial authority waning. This is our moment to rise above the chaos and present ourselves as a beacon of strength and stability.\n\nBy consolidating our power, fostering alliances, and demonstrating our ability to lead, we can position ourselves as a serious contender for the imperial throne. The Empire is crying out for a ruler who can restore order, command respect, and guide it toward a prosperous future. That ruler must be us. The path will not be easy, but with determination and vision, we can secure not only the imperial crown but also our legacy as saviors of the Empire."

 A11_trisfer_emperor_desc:0 "With our ascension to the imperial throne, a new era has dawned for the Empire of Anbennar.

By expanding the toll, we will extract even greater revenue from the bustling maritime trade, ensuring that every ship seeking to traverse these waters contributes to our prosperity.\n\nWhile this decision will undoubtedly provoke dissatisfaction among merchants and rival powers, they are left with little recourse. Our naval strength and control over this crucial chokepoint ensure that our will cannot be challenged."

 A11_ironwood_title:0 "Ironwood Harvest"
 A11_ironwood_desc:0 "The region of Southern Fangaula is home to the remarkable jungles of Ironwood, a unique and invaluable resource. This organic iron, which grows as sturdy, towering trees, is renowned across the land for its unparalleled strength and durability. Craftsmen and blacksmiths prize Ironwood for creating weapons, armor, and structures that rival steel in resilience while maintaining the flexibility of natural wood.\n\nDespite its versatility, the Ironwood tree's unique properties make it impossible to cultivate outside of its native jungles. This limitation ensures that Southern Fangaula remains the sole source of this precious material, granting the region significant strategic and economic value. By investing in the Ironwood industry, we can exploit this resource to its fullest potential."

The region not only serves as a key location for trade, but it is also home to ancient fortresses and ruins that could be repurposed to establish a strong foothold."

 A11_east_sarhal_title:0 "Riches of East Sarhal"
 A11_east_sarhal_desc:0 "The eastern Sarhali region of Bamaliwuni is a land of unparalleled wealth, rich in the most coveted resource of all—gold. Its rivers shimmer with golden deposits, and its mines promise a bounty that could secure the prosperity of our empire for generations to come.\n\nSecuring Bamaliwuni is not merely an ambition; it is a necessity. Control over this region will not only bolster our economy but also solidify our position as a dominant power in Sarhal. "

 A11_base_of_operations_title:0 "Base of Operations"
 A11_base_of_operations_desc:0 "To push further into the heart of Sarhal, we must establish a strong foothold from which to launch our operations and consolidate our influence. The area of Bivirir presents itself as an ideal location for this purpose. Unclaimed by any significant regional powers, it offers the perfect opportunity to construct a base of operations without the immediate threat of conflict."

 A11_canal_title:0 "The Dhal Canal"
 A11_canal_desc:0 "Our trade routes connecting the eastern reaches of Sarhal to Cannor are vital to the prosperity of our empire, yet the lengthy and perilous journey around the region of Ardimya hampers their efficiency and safety. To address this challenge, we have identified an ambitious solution, the construction of a canal through Jasiir Jadid. This monumental engineering project will drastically reduce travel times and provide a direct and secure passage for our ships.\n\nHowever, such an undertaking requires meticulous preparation. We must survey the land, gather the necessary resources, and design the infrastructure to support this massive endeavor."

 A11_promote_cloth_title:0 "Promote Cloth Industry"
 A11_promote_cloth_desc:0 "One of our most valuable industries is the production of fine cloth, a commodity that has long been sought after by nobles and merchants alike. By investing in the expansion of our textile industry, we can increase our production capacity, improve the quality of our goods, and secure a larger share of the market."

 A11_strengthen_court_title:0 "Strengthen the Court"
 A11_strengthen_court_desc:0 "As the foremost Pearlsedger nation in the Empire, we have long been the guiding force of the Pearl Court, a beacon of leadership and culture within our realm. Yet, time has not been kind to the court’s prestige, and our influence has begun to wane amidst the shifting tides of power in the Empire. To reclaim our rightful place and secure the court's future, we must act decisively.\n\nInvesting in the Pearl Court will revitalize its structure and purpose, transforming it into a center of excellence and refinement. By attracting the Empire's best and brightest—scholars, diplomats, merchants, and artisans—we can restore its reputation as a hub of innovation and leadership."

 A11_horakesh_title:0 "Dominate Horashesh"
 A11_horakesh_desc:0 "Horashesh, once a prosperous region due to the Kheteratan influence, has fallen into disarray and infighting between various warlords. The importance of the region as a trade hub cannot be understated, and it is time for us to assert our dominance over the region and bring order to the chaos."

 A11_west_sarhal_title:0 "Emerald Jungle"
 A11_west_sarhal_desc:0 "Our scouts have returned with promising news from the jungles of Dao Nako, a lush and untamed region in western Sarhal. Hidden beneath its dense canopy lie multiple gem mines, said to yield some of the most exotic and beautiful gems in all of Sarhal. These treasures of the earth would not only add to our already illustrious collection but also reinforce our position as the dominant power in the gem trade.\n\nBeyond the mines, the region's bustling trade posts are ripe with potential. By securing control over these vital hubs, we can establish a strong foothold in the region and leverage them to expand our influence deeper into Sarhal."

 A11_rich_jungle_title:0 "Rich Jungle"
 A11_rich_jungle_desc:0 "The jungle of Soruin holds an invaluable resource, not buried beneath the earth but standing tall above it—the trees themselves. These towering giants are unlike any other, boasting a remarkable combination of strength, durability, and surprising flexibility. Such qualities make them a perfect material for the construction of ships, particularly for the masts, hulls, and rigging components required for naval vessels of the highest quality."

 A11_invite_kin_title:0 "Invite Kin"
 A11_invite_kin_desc:0 "We are the proud descendants of Reavers, a fierce and bold people who once roamed the seas, seeking glory, riches, and a place in the annals of history. While we have embraced Anbennarian culture, our seafaring roots remain a cornerstone of our identity, shaping who we are and guiding our ambitions.\n\nYet, we are not the only heirs to this legacy. The realm of Deranne, ruled by the descendants of the notorious reaver queen, also claims this heritage, though their vision is far removed from our own. Tensions and rivalries have defined our interactions, as their ambitions clash with ours on the high seas and in the courts of Cannor.\n\nHowever, amidst these divides, there is another nation of reaver descent—Reveria. Reveria, like us, carries the traditions and spirit of their ancestors but has chosen a path that could align with our own goals. Establishing close relations with Reveria presents an opportunity to build a powerful maritime alliance, rooted in shared history and mutual respect."

 A11_ancestral_cold_title:0 "Ancestral Cold"
 A11_ancestral_cold_desc:0 "Dalr, the rugged and cold homeland of our ancestors, holds a deep and enduring place in our history. It was from those shores that our forebears set sail, braving the unknown seas to carve out a kingdom upon the fertile lands of Pearlsedge. Their courage and ambition laid the foundation for our legacy, and now, it is our time to honor their memory and reclaim their homeland in their name.\n\nWe shall retrace the steps of our ancestors, following the winds and waves that carried them to glory. This time, however, it will be Dalr that feels the might of Pearlsedge. We will return as conquerors, just as they once did with Cannor, asserting our dominion over the land that gave us life and strength."

 A11_defeat_gerudian_faith_title:0 "Integrate Skalds"
 A11_defeat_gerudian_faith_desc:0 "The Gerudians revere the legendary One-armed Skald, who lulled the Icy Dragon Elkaesel to sleep and taught them sacred songs to maintain her slumber. We can argue that the Master Skald ascended to divinity and holds a place within the Regent Court. This recognition would honor their traditions, ensure the songs are preserved, and ease their acceptance of our rule and faith. By blending their heritage with the Regent Court, we strengthen their loyalty while maintaining the songs' vital role in keeping the dragon asleep."

 A11_halfdals_legacy_title:0 "Halfdal's Legacy"
 A11_halfdals_legacy_desc:0 "Halfdal, one of the sons of Henrik Divenscourge, was a fierce warrior and raider whose name echoes through countless tales of his exploits in the Divenhal Sea. His most notable achievement was the conquest of Tef and the founding of the Reaver Kingdom of Divenhal. Though that kingdom has long since fallen, Halfdal's blood flows through our veins. It is our duty to honor his legacy and reclaim what he built, restoring the glory of his conquests under our banner."

 A11_unite_dalr_title:0 "Unite Dalr"
 A11_unite_dalr_desc:0 "Once again, we are united with our Gerudian cousins. Under our guidance, they will prosper and flourish as part of a greater whole.

 A11_buried_treasures_desc:0 "The region of Amadia stands as one of the most precious territories in Southern Aelantir. Its wealth is unparalleled, boasting vast reserves of gold and relics of a bygone era. Yet, its true treasure lies in its natural Damestear mines—an invaluable resource for mages across Cannor. Securing Amadia will not only enrich our coffers but also solidify our control over one of the most coveted magical resources in the world."

 A11_munas_shrine_title:0 "Shrines of Munas"
 A11_munas_shrine_desc:0 "Pearlsedge has always held a profound connection to the sea, a legacy tracing back to its proud reaver ancestry. It is only fitting that we revere Munas Moonsinger, the great elven captain and god of the seas, as our patron deity. To honor his name and secure his blessings for our fleets and the waves we traverse, we will construct magnificent shrines in his honor. Through these shrines, we shall reaffirm our bond with the sea and ensure safe passage for our ships as they journey across the waters of the world."

flavor_Pearlsedge.1.d: "Lorent, once our staunch ally during the Lilac Wars, now stands as a rival too ambitious for its own good. Their relentless drive to dominate imperial Lencenor and claim swathes of the West Dameshead has strained the bonds of our old alliance. The time has come to cast aside the memories of shared battles and decide their fate. Our future demands a firm stance, even if it means forsaking old allies for the greater good of the Empire."

flavor_Pearlsedge.3.d: "The island of Fahvanosy, with its resource-rich lands and strategic position, presents an intriguing opportunity. The halflings who inhabit it are open to trade and relations, offering potential allies well-versed in the intricacies of Sarhal. Their guidance could be invaluable in navigating the complexities of the region. Yet, the temptation to seize the island and secure its resources for ourselves cannot be ignored. The choice is clear: diplomacy and partnership, or conquest and dominion."
