 Assakadail_isl: "Sanctuary of Assakadail"
 Assakadail_isl_desc: "--------------\nAssakadail is a sacred island, deeply revered by the Chendhyans. It was here that the legendary Munakles first led the Devand refugees away from their Precursor masters in Taychend. During their journey toward the Mteibas Valley, it was on this very isle that a fateful division among his followers gave rise to the many tribes that would never reunite. \n\nWithin the great sanctuary of Askalyn, Munakles and his companions sought shelter before the coming of the Ruin. There, he rededicated his enchanted blade, Saerasyar, vowing it would never again serve evil. Since that moment, Assakadail has stood as a symbol of sacrifice, liberation, and spiritual unity to all Chendhyans. \n\nThe island is still guarded by the Durasyar — keepers of memory and wisdom gathered by elven sages and shamans over generations. To them, this place is a solemn reminder of the price of freedom. \n\nYet to others, Assakadail is not a sanctuary, but a scar. From this island rose the cry of liberty that led the Chendhyans to burn half of Taychend. To those who remember the flames, Assakadail stands not as a holy site, but as a mark of rebellion, betrayal — and the rightful target of retribution."

 Kannalulthe_city: "Great Dam City of Kannalulthe"
 Kannalulthe_city_desc: "--------------\nThe Great Dam City of Kannalulthe stands as one of the greatest achievements of the Second Gophiran Empire — a living testament to its ambition and grandeur. Originally built as a humble fort on the river leading to Gophira, Kannalulthe rapidly grew into the economic heart of Taychend. Merchant houses, slavers, artisans, and traders flocked to the city, eager to be near the center of imperial power. It expanded swiftly, becoming the de facto capital and surpassing even Nanru Nakar in size and population. Its architecture — cyclopean walls and arches, monumental temples and statues, and of course the immense dam that gave the city its name — inspired generations of architects and builders. \n\nThough the city fell during the reign of Erradal the Red Thunder, who razed it in a fit of cruelty and pride, Kannalulthe now experiences a second birth. The great dam once again towers unbroken, the inner district has been restored, and the outer manufacturing ring is returning to life."

 kainulu_sos_1_title: "Restoration of Kannalulthe: The First Waters"
 kainulu_sos_2_title: "Restoration of Kannalulthe: The Great Fields"
 kainulu_sos_1_desc: "With the restoration of the great dam, Kannalulthe has reclaimed its soul — water. Held back by thousands of tons of stone, the sacred river now flows once more under the control of our engineers and priests, feeding ancient canals and irrigating the forgotten floodplains. Around the city, fields begin to form anew, and with them, the first labor camps. Slaves, gathered from across the empire, are driven to the riverbanks to dig channels, clear the silt, and breathe life back into the lands that once fed all of Taychend." 
 kainulu_sos_2_desc: "As the irrigation network expands, Kannalulthe becomes not only a marvel of architecture but the heart of agricultural might. Entire valleys, once barren and cracked, now bloom once more. State overseers and slave drivers expand the network of labor camps, turning the river’s floodplain into a source of unending abundance. With every new harvest and every ploughed field, the Empire takes another step toward reclaiming the glory of the Second Gophiran Age."
 Kannalulthe_city_2: "Revived Irrigation Works"
 Kannalulthe_city_2_desc: "The ancient canals of Kannalulthe run with water once more. With the first wave of restoration complete, farmland expands and tax income grows, as the dam begins to reclaim its legacy as the lifeblood of Taychend."
 Kannalulthe_city_3: "Heart of the Floodplain Empire"
 Kannalulthe_city_3_desc: "The full power of Kannalulthe’s dam has been restored. Vast irrigated fields now surround the city, and slave-driven agriculture ensures a bountiful flow of wealth. The city is no longer just reborn — it thrives."

 Whiteharbour_title: "Whiteharbour Bastion of the Exiles"
 Whiteharbour: "Whiteharbour Bastion of the Exiles"
 Whiteharbour_desc: "--------------\nWhite Harbour, the glittering heart of Oremvand, was not born in glory — but in despair. It rose from exile, fear, and the unyielding resolve of one woman. Here, at the mouth of the Donzaern River, Princess Taneliata — leader of the broken White Faction — dropped anchor with the remnants of her people after fleeing from Nagar Vyéchei. Rejected by all southern ports and hunted by the triumphant Purples, they made one final wager — not on walls of stone, but on the strength of wooden ones. \n\nThe bastion that now crowns the cliffs above the harbour began as a watchtower, hastily assembled from shipwreck timber and scattered boulders. It was the first shield of the White Faction — and it was from here that Taneliata struck a decisive blow when the enemy fleet arrived to finish what they had started. Merchant ships repurposed into warships, unexpected tactics, and the defiance of the doomed allowed the exiles to seize an impossible victory. \n\nFrom the ashes of that battle, Oremvand was born. From this bastion, White Harbour grew into the greatest trade nexus of the southern coast. The old refuge was reshaped into the mightiest harbour east of Nagar Vyéchei — cradle of generations of famed admirals. \n\nBut White Harbour is not merely a monument to victory. It is the crucible in which Oremvand's identity was forged. Here, the mercantile Festvristani, seafaring Yodhanpiri, and war-hardened Chendhyan mercenaries united — forming a triune alliance that for centuries safeguarded the city against war, rebellion, and conquest."

 Royakottar_ruin_title: "Royakottar Ruin City"
 Royakottar_ruin: "Royakottar Ruin City"
 Royakottar_ruin_desc: "--------------\nWhere once loomed the Steel-Scorched Citadel — a fearsome bastion of the Precursor Empire — now rises Royakottar, a monstrous fusion of metal, brick, and ambition. Centuries ago, refugees and scavengers flocked here, fleeing the starfire that consumed the old world, drawn by the lure of relics buried beneath twisted steel and ash. From this graveyard of titans, a new city was born — alive with smoke, forges, and the eternal hunger for forgotten power. \n\nFour families now rule over the ruins like feudal lords of a fallen age. The Kattyva scour the land for ancient salvage. The Vustarin reforge lost relics into weapons and wonders. The Ursibadur revel in vice and crime beneath flickering artificer-lamps. The Nymkorai trade relics like coin, their caravans spreading Royakottar’s reach across all of Taychend. Every brick in the city is mortared with ambition, every wall plated in the bones of the old world. \n\nRoyakottar is no ordinary city. It is a scavenger’s kingdom, a forge of forbidden genius, a monument to survival through cunning and fire. To rule it is to dance with ghosts — and to risk becoming one of them."

 nagar_vye: "Vaults of Uyas Enret"
 nagar_vye_desc: "--------------\nDeep underground, where once rang the clatter of pickaxes and the screams of thousands of slaves — captured through raids or sold into bondage via the ruthless markets of warlord republics — now echo only the scratch of quills and the rasp of parchment. When the golden veins of Uyas Enret ran dry, Nagar Vyechey did not dig deeper. Instead, the isolated network of shafts was repurposed into something far more enduring: vaults for the very gold once hewn from their walls. Irony, indeed. \n\nThus was born the first and oldest bank in the history of Taichend — an institution of surprising sophistication, considering it grew from the ashes of a warlord’s rise. Powered by its financial system and control over the only deepwater port in the entire region, Nagar Vyechey soon became the beating heart of the slave trade — the second greatest craft in Taichend, just after war itself. \n\nIn a land where warfare is a trade and slaves are coin, the port thrives, and the old mines fill once again — not with ore, but with tribute. The vaults spiral deeper, the ledgers thicken, and the flow of gold becomes a tide no ruler can resist. \n\nAll gold flows to Uyas Enret. And no one dares ask where it goes."

 Hakar_Mlerek_pal: "Vanetavanem — The Sky-Piercing House"
 Hakar_Mlerek_pal_desc: "--------------\nAt the intersection of ambition and antiquity, where the southeastern heights of Nakar Mlerek meet the heartlands of Nanru Nakar, rises Vanetavanem — the Sky-Piercing House, a monolithic palace of gleaming stone and mythic legacy. Built in the twilight days of the Liandarch but brought to full glory under Pelozhil and his descendants, Vanetavanem served not merely as the seat of the Mudalaar line — it was the keystone of a civilization. \n\nMore than a royal residence, Vanetavanem once anchored a node of the teleportation lattice of the Flying City Tacenie — and deep within its sealed vaults lie relics of that ancient sorcery, humming still with half-silenced purpose. Its façade is austere, carved in immense, unadorned stone — but beyond the outer walls unfold halls of unimaginable opulence: blue marble from Parakhachend, ceiling frescoes painted by the wandering masters of Katelparai, carpets woven by the silk clans of Mlerek’s inner markets. \n\nEvery wall tells a story, every corridor once held court — tribute from distant provinces, heirlooms from shattered dynasties, and symbols of loyalty or conquest all found their place within. In its high-vaulted throne room, once called the Hall of Three Echoes, generations of Mudalaars sat in judgment, until the day it echoed last — with the death of the moderate hero Ebenant. \n\nEven in ruin or occupation, Vanetavanem stood firm — a claim to legitimacy, a symbol of resilience, and eventually, during the formation of the Triple Compact, the defiant political heart of the South. Here emissaries negotiated, armies pledged, and destinies entwined."

 Nakar_Kilaiek_str: "Mavihanavao – The Road of Warriors"
 Nakar_Kilaiek_str_desc: "--------------\nMavihanavao, the “Road of Warriors,” cuts through the heart of Nakar Kriadvai — not merely a street or a military district, but a vast war-machine in stone and steel. It is a living engine of conquest and defiance. From the Teshalanine Arsenal, where the arms of the Nakari hosts are forged, to the Fortress of Varelrudu, command center of the City Guard, and the siege workshops whose designs have broken cities beyond counting — Mavihanavao is the epicenter of Mudaliar military doctrine. \n\nIts alleys echo with the sounds of sparring blades, its plazas host duels of prestige, and its arenas thrum with bloodsport where warriors prove themselves before roaring crowds. Even the slave market at the district's edge is a cog in this machine, where captives of war are traded to fund future campaigns. \n\nYet Mavihanavao is not just where armies are made — it is where ideologies are sharpened. It was here that the doctrine of Bladeborn Right emerged: the belief that authority comes not from bloodline, but from victory. From these stones marched not only generals, but bastards who would become heirs, and rebels who would found dynasties."

 Nakar_Kriadvai_nizh_title: "Depths of Kriadvai"
 Nakar_Kriadvai_nizh: "Depths of Kriadvai"
 Nakar_Kriadvai_nizh_desc: "--------------\nFar beneath the streets of Nanru Nakar, past the flickering lanterns of the Undercity and into the ancient, sealed warrens of the deep, lies the shadowed complex known only as The Depths of Kriadvai. It is not a palace, nor a fortress, nor even a traditional seat of power — it is something far more dangerous: a place where truth and influence are bought, traded, archived, and buried. \n\nBorn in the aftermath of civil war and refined through generations of intrigue, the Depths are the invisible heart of the Triple Alliance. Within its twisting halls, once ancient storage tunnels and ruined vaults of forgotten empires, lies the Hall of Silent Affairs — a clandestine council chamber where informants, diplomats, syndicates, and cults meet in whispered unity. Here, assassinations are planned with the same precision as trade deals, and betrayals are charted with maps and ledgers. \n\nThe Depths serve as the administrative core of Kriadvai’s vast intelligence and diplomatic networks. Files detailing the secrets of foreign rulers sit beside ancient relics scavenged from the Underwarrens, and every corridor hums with enchantments meant to silence, deceive, or kill. \n\nNot a soul walks into the Depths uninvited. But those who do, those granted passage by the will of the Mudaliars or the cultic Na’Sendali, find themselves in the company of whispering powerbrokers whose reach extends far beyond the city’s walls. While the Mlerek handle diplomacy with crowns and embassies, and the Kilaiek command armies and streets, the Kriadvai rule in the shadows — balancing the rival branches of the Mudaliar family, ensuring cooperation, and subtly guiding the fate of Nanru Nakar itself. \n\nMore than a great building, The Depths of Kriadvai are an institution — the shadow government of Nanru Nakar, the nervous system of a city constantly teetering between collapse and ascendance. To control the Depths is to know secrets, shape alliances, and, perhaps, to decide who rules the next age."

 Urvand_mine_title: "City of Opulence"
 Urvand_mine: "City of Opulence"
 Urvand_mine_desc: "--------------\nRising atop the windswept cliffs of the Larankarha highlands, the city of Urvand stands as a golden testament to ambition, sacrifice, and power. Born in rebellion and fire, it was built by the freed slaves of Merialeth the Manumitter—once a captive in the mines, later the liberator and queen who ended tyranny with a blade of magic and forged a new destiny for her people. \n\nDeep beneath its glittering towers, the mines stretch endlessly, veins of gold that have never run dry. For centuries, criminals and slaves have labored in the oppressive dark, fueling the rise of an empire. And above—stone palaces, golden domes, streets paved in wealth. Urvand is not merely a city; it is a symbol. \n\nYet behind every shining wall lies shadow. The wealth of Urvand hides the brutal truth of the labor that sustains it. It is a city of contradictions: magnificence built on misery, order shaped by force. Still, to rule Urvand is to rule perception. What greater power than a city so radiant it makes obedience look like destiny?"

 Fateweaver_title: "The Fateweaver"
 Fateweaver: "The Fateweaver"
 Fateweaver_desc: "--------------\nDeep beneath the ancient stones of Korrimutren, in the hidden heart of a long-buried Precursor ruin, floats the skeletal remains of Kanelethiel the Fateweaver. Her body, suspended in midair by golden cables shimmering with arcane light, lies at the core of an immense and unfathomable relic. It is said that those with the gift of true divination may touch her ancient bones and hear her voice — a whisper from beyond time, revealing glimpses of the future with terrifying clarity. \n\nTo the Taychendi, she is more than a prophet — she is a god-hero, a divine presence whose words have shaped centuries. Her cult, led by the enigmatic Threadbearer, gathers the finest oracles and seers of the region, and her shrine in Korrimutren has become a sacred pilgrimage site. Here, seekers come to beg for visions, to peer into the mists of fate — and sometimes, to find their own undoing. For the relic is not without danger: to the unworthy or unprepared, its power is deadly. \n\nThe Fateweaver is no passive relic of bygone ages. Her prophecies have driven wars, shattered empires, and forged new ones from the ashes. It was she who foresaw the fall of the First Gophiran Empire, and it was her revelation that granted Laskaris the Conqueror a fate-bound certainty of victory — and of death. Some claim she can speak the exact moment a ruler will perish, granting them a grim shield of immortality: unshakable will through perfect knowledge of their end. But such a gift may be a curse. To know one’s destiny is to be shackled by it."

 tkachuk.d: "Before you stands the Fateweaver — a withered oracle entombed in bone and silver, her eye sockets aglow with embers of forgotten time. This ancient relic does not speak, yet her presence stirs the winds of destiny. Those who dare to seek her counsel may glimpse a fragment of the fate yet to come. But her guidance is never without price — and the path she reveals will forever mark your soul and kingdom alike. Choose the thread of fate you would pull, and it shall be woven into the tapestry of your reign."

Here, the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak swore an eternal oath to protect their homeland from all who would threaten it. The blood-red banners flying from its ramparts became symbols not only of fear but of resolve, discipline, and unyielding military prowess. \n\nMore than a fortress, Rakkabuttai was a bastion — a forge of warriors and a living reminder of the price of vigilance. Its barracks housed thousands, its armories brimmed with Kheionai steel, and its towers watched the steppes for signs of encroaching warbands. For centuries, no enemy could take it by force or cunning, and every stone of the pass is soaked in the blood of those who tried."
