verne_flavor_ace.1.t: "A Societal Shift"
verne_flavor_ace.1.d: "The Verneman with their long standing martial culture, its large freed peasant population and its control over the copper rich Khenak has found itself telling a much different story than the feudal polities that surround itself in the Empire. The relative overpopulation, desire for glory and many feuding counts, disputes and ambitious princes has led many Vernman seeking employment and glory in the service of different foreign rulers and governors. This trend was spurred further with the coming of the Greentide and the lilac wars, never had the desire for a Verneman regiment been higher and never had the supply been so great. Now however the many veterans of the decades past wars seek to buy land back in their homeland clashing with local nobles over land grants. The nobles fearing this be to be the final death knell of the traditional feudal order in Verne seek an appeal with the court to implement a seemingly mundane land reform which would have the effect of ennobling landholders who pay a premium a desperate bid to divide and integrate the vast amount of hopeful new lords. The consequences of the dealings of this issue could potentially be longstanding for the future of Verne."
verne_flavor_ace.1.a: "The decision should ultimately reside with the Duke"

verne_flavor_ace.2.t: "Administrating Khenak"
verne_flavor_ace.2.d: "The conquest of the full Khenak range has left a difficult question for our administration. The mountain range is poorly understood, has been inhabited by the Hill Gnolls for centuries and divided into dozens of factions in the most ill traversable parts of the range. The relations of the Hill Gnolls can be played into instead of the usual feudal hierarchy although this hands off approach leaves them off of the rich resource and mining of the Khenak."
verne_flavor_ace.2.a: "Exploit the Khenaks populace and resources."
verne_flavor_ace.2.b: "Try a softer approach"

verne_flavor_ace.3.t: "The Oldtower Offer"
verne_flavor_ace.3.d: "Old tower is ostensibly owned by the Magisterium it however used to be held by the old kingdom of Verne. As one of the oldest magical stronghold and library of the region its prestige and collection would aid greatly in the building of capable facilities to hold and tame the hatchlings we have in our care. The magister has already been sounded out for an offer with only the price needing to be set in the potential negotiation."
verne_flavor_ace.3.a: "Make a modest bid"
verne_flavor_ace.3.b: "Do everything diplomatically possible"

verne_flavor_ace.4.t: "Verne Offers To Buy Oldtower"
verne_flavor_ace.4.d: "The Duke of Verne has suddenly began to put out bids for Oldtower whilst simultaneously sounding us out for a price on its potential sale."
verne_flavor_ace.4.a: "The terms are most acceptable"
verne_flavor_ace.4.b: "We shall not give these vagabonds our land"

verne_flavor_ace.5.t: "Sale of Oldtower Accepted"
verne_flavor_ace.5.d: "It seems our diplomatic overtures over a sale of Old tower have been met with a resounding success. There is still more leases and documents to sign and ratify in different parliaments and registers but after a few ceremonies at the conclusion of the month Oldtower will be once again Vernman."
verne_flavor_ace.5.a: "The terms are most acceptable"

verne_flavor_ace.6.t: "Sale of Oldtower Denied"
verne_flavor_ace.6.d: "In the final closing offers and diplomatic signings for a potential sale of Old tower diplomatic relations have been suddenly broken off. It seems that Oldtower is far too valuable for the sums we have offered and now only half finished documents and signings are all that shows of it."
verne_flavor_ace.6.a: "Damn them! Move the construction site closer to the court and pay the extra expense"

verne_flavor_ace.7.t: "Eborthili Alliance"
verne_flavor_ace.7.d: "The lilac wars had proved disastrous for the moon party but in the Battle of the Busilari Straits we had found a stunning victory alongside the Eborthili navy to crush the lion armada. The cooperation and mutual disdain against Busilar has kindled strong diplomatic ties with Eborthil and has prompted the promotion of a war game to be held with the only question being on its focus."
verne_flavor_ace.7.a: "Focus on Land Coordination"
verne_flavor_ace.7.b: "Further Our Naval Cooperation"

verne_flavor_ace.8.t: "Verneman-Eborthili protection pact"
verne_flavor_ace.8.d: "The final defeat of Busilar has shown us as the senior partner in the alliance with Eborthil although it has not shown the end of cooperation. The Divenhaul has unfortunately continued to throw more troubles to both of our nations with continued cooperation requiring further integration of efforts. Many of our statesmen and generals have contributed a draft cementing our cooperation with Eborthil as well as our seniorship further. The idea around the treaty has met some positive reception though the general mood around it has been that it requires certain guarantees."
verne_flavor_ace.8.a: "Heres to hoping to fair negotiations"

verne_flavor_ace.9.t: "Debates Over Autonomy"
verne_flavor_ace.9.d: "In one of the the less monotonous meetings concerning the development of a protection pact with Eborthil a delegation of minor nobles and magnates has arrived. They have tried to make a case to include an extension of protections and privileges they maintain currently in the protection of the Eborthili crown in the current draft of the treatises. Their presence has been detracting from some of the planned topics for the day which have been more important.\nCurrent §YEborthili Favor§! [Root.verne_eborthil_chance.GetValue]"
verne_flavor_ace.9.a: "Assure them that they will maintain their privileges"
verne_flavor_ace.9.b: "Redirect the conversation back on topic"

verne_flavor_ace.10.t: "Fears Over Employment"
verne_flavor_ace.10.d: "\nCurrent §YEborthili Favor§! [Root.verne_eborthil_chance.GetValue]"
verne_flavor_ace.10.a: "Attempt to compensate them for their previous employment"
verne_flavor_ace.10.b: "Dismiss their petitions and concerns"

verne_flavor_ace.11.t: "Question of Common Defense"
verne_flavor_ace.11.d: "\nCurrent §YEborthili Favor§! [Root.verne_eborthil_chance.GetValue]"
verne_flavor_ace.11.a: "Promise Vernman Regiments to their defense"
verne_flavor_ace.11.b: "Lend them officers and officials"

verne_flavor_ace.12.t: "Delagating Foriegn Affairs"
verne_flavor_ace.12.d: "\nCurrent §YEborthili Favor§! [Root.verne_eborthil_chance.GetValue]"
verne_flavor_ace.12.a: "Grant them broad capability for for their own decisions"
verne_flavor_ace.12.b: "Require a Vernish ambassador to approve of their decisions"

verne_flavor_ace.13.t: "The Treaty Finished"
verne_flavor_ace.13.d: "\nCurrent §YEborthili Favor§! [Root.verne_eborthil_chance.GetValue]"
verne_flavor_ace.13.a: "Our seniority over them is evident and our protection benevolent"
verne_flavor_ace.13.b: "Hopefully our compromises prove fruitful"
verne_flavor_ace.13.c: "A hard bargain but a good one"

verne_flavor_ace.14.t: "Verneman Protection"
verne_flavor_ace.14.d: "Negotiations over a potential alliance and protection pact with Verne have concluded. Our security seems to have been well guaranteed though certain sovereignty would have to be conceded to maintain this. It would be possible to crap the deal in its entirety before the ink dries though it would anger Verne."
verne_flavor_ace.14.a: "The Verneman are our friends their protection is needed"
verne_flavor_ace.14.b: "We shall not give up our sovereignty"

verne_flavor_ace.15.t: "Eborthil Breaks Ties"
verne_flavor_ace.15.d: "It seems at the end of the summit of negotiations Eborthil has suddenly and disrespectfully left the conference. The treaty had largely been complete and ready for signing which has surprised many of our officials. This shock has quickly melted into anger with many statesmen now seeing military enforcement of the treaty being the only possible way to restore Verne’s honor."
verne_flavor_ace.15.a: "Damn them we shall enforce the treaty ourselves"


verne_flavor_ace.16.t: "Reform of the Regiments?"
verne_flavor_ace.16.d: "In one of the more impactful sessions in the wyvern reform committee a group of delegates and commanders has presented a series of treaties detailing the formation of massed wyvern units. The treaties seems to likely be the talk and direction of the committee for the next few weeks with opposition and counter treaties being instantly formed and drafted. The basis of the massed formations seems to mimic developments in infantry formations as well as accentuating the potential to annihilate any army the formation might come across. The opposition says that it would be an unreally force to properly manage and supply and that the regiments system's low concentration allows it to react better to local circumstances. Before a gridlock devops and other less controversial topics of reform become neglected it might be necessary to make a decision."
verne_flavor_ace.16.a: "Let us build "all Wyvern Armies""
verne_flavor_ace.16.b: "Strengthen the regimental system"

verne_flavor_ace.17.t: "A High Temple Adventure"
verne_flavor_ace.17.d: "An expedition to a High temple has recently hired a contingent of our bravest adventurers . It could be an excellent opportunity to see what lies within. Due to the nature of this rare opportunity the adventurers have contacted government officials to try to levy more resources in exchange for the information that will be gained from this expedition. There is plenty of opportunity to try and gain resources and knowledge from this venture without directly supporting them though it can be potentially useful."
verne_flavor_ace.17.a: "Levy state resources to assist"
verne_flavor_ace.17.b: "Let it remain a private contract"

verne_flavor_ace.18.t: "A Difference In Philosophy"
verne_flavor_ace.18.d: "Coming from opposite sides of Halann it was inevitable that the different schools of thinking would lead to some clashes in regards to exploring the temple. The clash has happened earlier than initially hoped as the procedure of exploration and of starting has caused an argument. The Halessi hosts calls for a thorough examination and documentation of all things, whilst the group of mercenaries call for less documentation in favor of covering ground."
verne_flavor_ace.18.a: "Rely on the local expertise"
verne_flavor_ace.18.b: "Leverage contract obligations"

verne_flavor_ace.19.t: "Traversing the High Temple"
verne_flavor_ace.19.d: "The expedition has made solid progress into the temple following a seemingly reliable map whilst noting and collecting different temple workings and trinkets. The good fortune of the map has seemingly run dry though as a wall reinforced with the high temple’s ward has blocked passage. The Halessi hosts are bothered by the wall having not been on the map but have come prepared with another Korashi drill to go through it. Another feature not mentioned on the map however is an entrance flanking the opposite side of the wall to what seems like a labyrinth of tunnels that may offer a faster and more direct way through."
verne_flavor_ace.19.a: "Fortune favors the bold the maze shall be conquered"
verne_flavor_ace.19.b: "Allow the experts to continue their drilling"

verne_flavor_ace.20.t: "Ambush In The Labyrinth"
verne_flavor_ace.20.d: "Traversing through the tunnels of the high temple has desensitized the group to many of the creaks and odd noises that come from every direction. One seemingly innocent noise was actually a member of the group tripping a stone pressure plate which then swallowed up a number of men. The group reacted quickly and managed to save a few of those form a very perilous looking fall but a solid portion of the group and their supplies will never be heard from again."
verne_flavor_ace.20.a: "Carelessness will find no clemency in this place"

verne_flavor_ace.21.t: "Always Go Left"
verne_flavor_ace.21.d: "A prevailing sentiment throughout the group was to continue through the tunnels in one direction eventually though it seems this had proved fruitless as they kept on finding the same tunnels. Going around in a circle though the map holder had managed to find a pattern that lined up with what should've been a far away section of the map. Following this route led to another section of tunnels that corresponded with another part of the map which after much frustration finally brought the group to the end of the labyrinth."
verne_flavor_ace.21.a: "The way is lit, the path is clear we require only the strength to follow it."

verne_flavor_ace.22.t: "The Drill Overheats"
verne_flavor_ace.22.d: "The spare Korashi drill that the Halessi hosts brought was a much smaller one meant so that it could be carried without much hassle though its lesser performance is now being felt by all members of the party. Due to some poor handling from a junior member of the party the drill has temporarily broken as it had been run for too long. The expert of the drill says that at the current rate and once the drill has been repaired it could take a day or so to get through the wall."
verne_flavor_ace.22.a: "Wake me when we break through"

verne_flavor_ace.23.t: "Smooth Progress"
verne_flavor_ace.23.d: "Drilling through the wall has demanded much more time and effort than originally thought would be needed. Thankfully though the largest issue the party currently faces is thankfully boredom. with occasional clattering chunks of debris loudly signifying progress the party just has to wait a little longer."
verne_flavor_ace.23.a: "Patience is a virtue"

verne_flavor_ace.24.t: "Breaching Relic Vaults"
verne_flavor_ace.24.d: "Though the map seems to have largely been outdated and wrong, the etchings had proven distinctive enough to mark out the inner sanctums of the temple when the party encountered them. The vaults however seem far too lightly packed for what the Halessi contingent had expected though the map again seemed to hide other features of the high temple. Side doors of the vault lead to an annex that could potentially is completely undocumented in the map and tails of this temple causing rampant speculation about further treasure."
verne_flavor_ace.24.a: "We should stay safe and find the exit"
verne_flavor_ace.24.b: "Theres bound to be more chambers"

verne_flavor_ace.25.t: "Boulder Trap"
verne_flavor_ace.25.d: "After much deliberation the group decided to continue on with exploring wherever the annex might lead. Though many of the doors lead to small empty rooms or long derelict closets there lies a promising and long corridor. Just when the group thought that the corridor was about to come to an end, someone stumbled unknowingly along a wire. The the rest of the group in the annex was very suddenly startled when the corridor team came running back with a boulder following them thankfully a majority of the team came back though some people and all of the equipment they took with them was now on the other side of the boulder that blocked off the corridor."
verne_flavor_ace.25.a: "Ancient traps lie in wait, unsprung and thirsting for blood..."

verne_flavor_ace.26.t: "Precursor Shrine"
verne_flavor_ace.26.d: "After much deliberation the group decided to continue on with exploring wherever the annex might lead. Though many of the doors lead to small empty rooms or long derelict closets there lied a small unassuming trapdoor. Squeezing into what seemed to be a sewer vent from the smell revealed to the delight of the unfortunate fellow tasked with climbing down a room. Further inspection did reveal an exposed sewage way in the corner of the room but also another set of boxes and drawers full of different artifacts."
verne_flavor_ace.26.a: "Hopefully there is some perfume in there"

verne_flavor_ace.27.t: "A Job Well Done"
verne_flavor_ace.27.d: "After a great deal of excavation and exploration the high temple party has returned and the contract of the mercenaries expired splitting the parties paths. As part of the rewards for the assistance there was a variety of fine Halessi coin being given to the mercenaries which with some clever barter has been trade away for a small Korashi drill. Normally these devices are highly protected by Halessi merchants but it seems the comradery built through the expedition has aided the charisma of the captain of the first Cannorian to have this technological marvel."
verne_flavor_ace.27.a: "The Korashi Drill and its secrets finally ours."

verne_flavor_ace.28.t: "An Expedition to Kheinoai"
verne_flavor_ace.28.d: "Exploration of Kheinoai is going to have to be much different than any previous expedition into Aelantir. The amount of settled and developed states in the area presents a grand opportunity to expand existing trade links though it will take some tact and perhaps coercion. An expedition has been enthusiastically encouraged and sponsored by the ambitious adventurer Castina síl Thanallen. With rumors of other similar expeditions to the Kheinoai for trade and conquest we should act fast to support her endeavors."
verne_flavor_ace.28.a: "A grandiose opportunity set sail immediately"

verne_flavor_ace.29.t: "The Question of Intrusion"
verne_flavor_ace.29.d: "It seems unfortunately the expedition despite some initial friendliness and good relations the prolonged intrusion of the expedition is increasingly being met with hostility. Whilst not initiating much of the conflicts Castina has continually prevented deescalation and has escalated different encounters. Whilst not being a particular great start a consensus was reached between the colonial officer and Castina that continued mapping and exploration of the Kheinoai would need more men and arms with the current approach."
verne_flavor_ace.29.a: "Continue down a more discreet and formal approach"
verne_flavor_ace.29.b: "Mapping these strange lands is essential and being discreet a luxury"

verne_flavor_ace.30.t: "Sieging Inadequacies"
verne_flavor_ace.30.d: "Whilst small scale, conflict against different antagonistic forces in the Kheinoai has continually gone in favor of the expedition thanks to the leadership of Castina. An emerging issue though has been seen in the lack of firepower able to punch through fortifications. Most fortifications encountered have been mostly field works or old walls which thankfully can be maneuvered around and shot at for some effect. Castina however has ambitions to bring down much more than just field works and has sent a request to the colonial officer for bombards to be brought to the expedition."
verne_flavor_ace.30.a: "Sending more men is to costly"
verne_flavor_ace.30.b: "Providing an adequate siege force is perhaps possible"

verne_flavor_ace.31.t: "Jobs for the Boys"
verne_flavor_ace.31.d: "The colonial bureaucracy has become more and more anxious with each message returned from Castina as she continually promotes her own members to act as officials and diplomats. This situation leaves the colonial bureaucracy at the mercy of strangers they don't fully trust in ability or character. Internal services have begun to draft a mandate demanding the reassignment of people promoted by Castina with experienced bureaucrats."
verne_flavor_ace.31.a: "Insist on official administrators"
verne_flavor_ace.31.b: "A job well done deserves promotion"

verne_flavor_ace.32.t: "The Kheionais Campaign Begins"
verne_flavor_ace.32.d: "After a series of ambushes Castina and the expedition have been driven southwards into Kheinoai, being able to stop the assailants right before the coast. Breaking with the colonial authority who insist on a diplomatic solution, she has seized an area in Dnagutakh in the south of Devand with the intent of bringing the neighboring countries under her command. The colonial office is in a panic as they have sanctioned Castina’s expedition which has now called upon the mainland to support her conquests."
verne_flavor_ace.32.a: "The die is cast"

verne_flavor_ace.33.t: "An Expidition to Taychend"
verne_flavor_ace.33.d: "Early expeditions into to attempt to bypass the Leechdens had traversed unbearable swamps and awful jungles to end up against Veyil Sikhara mountains stunting exploration of what would be Taychend. It took some time more before contact and discovery of the Taychendi states with more and more information being learned from the shielded land bringing more intrigue. Veterans from the old Effelai expeditions and ambitious adventures now seek to start another expedition to properly go past the Veyil Sikhara and learn more about this mysterious lands."
verne_flavor_ace.33.a: "They are already divided we may only need to conquer"

verne_flavor_ace.34.t: "The Need for Sturdier Mounts"
verne_flavor_ace.34.d: "The lands of Taychend hold a far different environment then the neighboring Effelai forests being much more mountainous and hilly. This was first noticed by eye but now on the wear on the different beasts of burden being particularly unsuited for the environment. This becomes a greater and greater issue as the expedition encounters further and further signs of mass banditry and wanton violence in the region. The colonial office now needs to debate trying to send a mission to gather more suitable mounts and then transport them to one of the most dangerous parts of Aelantir."
verne_flavor_ace.34.a: "They will have to make do with what they have"
verne_flavor_ace.34.b: "Perhaps the next ship could bring some oxen and mules"

verne_flavor_ace.35.t: "Warlord Ambitions"
verne_flavor_ace.35.d: "Along what started as a fairly ordinary march the Taychend expedition ran into another group of soldiers which quickly began attacking them. The skirmish had turned against the expedition when another group of ruinborn began to attack the assailants having appeared suddenly in the heat of battle. The skirmish had killed the previous captain Alano s’il Verne, though the majority of the party thanks to the friendly Ruinborn had managed to survive. The Ruinborn host began to explain to the next in command Cicero Silebor what had begun to be pieced together by the expedition regarding the rampant warlordism in Taychend. The Ruinborn warriors now encourage Cicero to chase after their assailants and begin to protect and rule this area as the previous host has been marauding across this land. This presents a decent opportunity to begin to grow a native contingent that knows the land though they only swear allegiance if Cicero takes the mantle of ruler."
verne_flavor_ace.35.a: "Allow him to continue his pretense"
verne_flavor_ace.35.b: "Insist he discourage any thought"

verne_flavor_ace.36.t: "A Question of Detente"
verne_flavor_ace.36.d: "It seems that we are not the only ones with interests in the knowledge of Taychend as [taychend_36_target.GetName] has approached us with a most unusual offer. They are offering us for a relatively modest price their maps and knowledge of Taychend which has proven extensive. We know that their recent forays have been severely hampered by the warring of the region so it is likely they are trying to have us pull their chestnuts out of the fire by bringing in more targets then just them. The knowledge of the region though is extensive and perhaps still to good with the cynics of the court still being skeptical about any potential aid going to [taychend_36_target.GetName]."
verne_flavor_ace.36.a: "Aiding [taychend_36_target.GetName] is to great a cost"
verne_flavor_ace.36.b: "It is perhaps good to be friendly"

verne_flavor_ace.37.t: "The Taychend Campaign Begins"
verne_flavor_ace.37.d: "The Taychend expedition started with high hopes of uncovering a mystical and exotic land filled with the potential of trade began to die with the sights of rampant destruction and war. This land would have made the most brutal depictions of Agrados made tame at times with the expedition continually having to fight their way through ambushes and highway robbery. Cicero Silebor having taken leadership of a continually larger and larger host with the defeat of many of the petty bands of the land now sees only the only way to truly have the region be malleable to varnish interests is to conquer it. Having seized a port at Ursibamkq he now faces his army to the north in order to secure a better base of operations."
verne_flavor_ace.37.a: "Fortune favors the brave"

verne_flavor_ace.38.t: "Reform Of The Colonial Method"
verne_flavor_ace.38.d: "Our Colonial method has been a lead to the conquest of some of the greatest empires of Aelantir. Though the method has hardly been great for the governance of vast territories and has led to the underdevelopment of regions. It has led to some sloppy governance and control over our theoretically vast empire and as such new conditions propel a change in our method."
verne_flavor_ace.38.a: "Restructure their finances to be more mercantilistic"
verne_flavor_ace.38.b: "Developing better legal codes for them should be the priority"
verne_flavor_ace.38.c: "Reinforce the adventurer spirit in the colonies"


verne_flavor_ace.39.t: "The Conquistadors Legacy"
verne_flavor_ace.39.d: "The early expeditions to Taychend and the Kheinoai were led by conquistadors of legendary fame battling elements and armies against all odds. Their legacy lives in our vast possessions in Aelantir but also in the regiments that evolved from their initial expeditions. These long lasting regiments can prove to be an incredibly loyal and tactical tool for conflicts in the region we may only need to establish their tradition and formalize them."
verne_flavor_ace.39.a: "May their triumphs be eternal"

verne_flavor_ace.40.t: "Investigations into precursor ruins"
verne_flavor_ace.40.d: "Investigations into precursor settlements in Taychend have born a great deal of fruit. Already a great deal of new technological insight and progress has been gained from exploration. The wells of old technology have spawned a question of whether or not to keep the artifacts in the region so as to best gleam their purpose or to begin shipment of relics back to the mainland."
verne_flavor_ace.40.a: "See if this can be applied to artificer studies"
verne_flavor_ace.40.b: "It belongs in a museum for general studies of course"

verne_flavor_ace.41.t: "The Honors of Conquest"
verne_flavor_ace.41.d: "The recent calls for an expedition into the Ynn has sparked a competition between the two groups of frontiersmen in Noruin. The Ynnic Mariners have policed and maintained a good balance along the Ynn estuary into the trolls bay whilst regularly traversing upstream. The Ynn rangers help maintain and explore the eastern half of Noruin they are use to skirmishing along and into the ynn to chase threats out of our territory in Noruin a rugged and demanding task."
verne_flavor_ace.41.a: "The mariners will be able to best tame the Ynn"
verne_flavor_ace.41.b: "The Rangers will be well suited to the wild and untamed lands"

verne_flavor_ace.42.t: "Calls for an Eordand Expedition"
verne_flavor_ace.42.d: "Eordand is land of season, mystery, the fey and precursor relics. Their isolation and unity has prevent much interference in their land though the bounty it has prompted many attempts. This wealth and connection to the mystery of the fey has built interest in another grand expedition to conduct a campaign of conquest and exploration into Eordand."
verne_flavor_ace.42.a: "The answers to the mysteries of the Feyrealm so close to our grasp"

verne_flavor_ace.43.t: "Traversing the portal"
verne_flavor_ace.43.d: "The Feyrealm within the Domandrod seems more agitated and malleable than usual. In some spots what would usually lead to an impassable barrier or impossible barrier has brocken down allowing for travel into the odd realm."
verne_flavor_ace.43.a: "The Domandrod calls"

verne_flavor_ace.44.t: "Folding in the Ynnic Adventurers"
verne_flavor_ace.44.d: "The Ynnic Expanse is perhaps as difficult to manage and live in as it is vast. This has not dissuaded many different independent Cannorian parties from attempting to claim a piece of land. These adventurers however may be amicable however to our colonial administration and an invitation to fold them into our influence may be in order."
verne_flavor_ace.44.a: "Sound out their diplomats perhaps we may convince them"


verne_flavor_ace.45.t: "Offer of Protection from Verne"
verne_flavor_ace.45.d: "Verne as the senior partner of our alliance in recent years has offered us a more favorable status in protection and cooperation. This offer would come at the cost of our sovereignty however."
verne_flavor_ace.45.a: "The offer is generous and perhaps to good"
verne_flavor_ace.45.b: "We must never fold in our sovereignty"

verne_flavor_ace.46.t: "Picking Favorites"
verne_flavor_ace.46.d: "Our policy to attempt to unify the minor Vernmen cities into a sort of client has met much success and now has the backing of the luna’s lords. Though we have secured all of the support we may need to build our client state, the different leaders of the former nations have still sought to fight and conceded for the right to hold position as the nominal leader. Since it is now them seeking something from us differing concessions can now be attempted to be battered for the esteemed position of the favorite of the Vernman court."
verne_flavor_ace.46.a: "Surely the count of Galèinn can oblige more exports of salt"
verne_flavor_ace.46.b: "The patronage of the adventurer hub of Menibor is surely a great boon"
verne_flavor_ace.46.c: "The debt of the great port of the old kingdom of verne is advantageous"

verne_flavor_ace.47.t: "The Valiant Keep Offer"
verne_flavor_ace.47.d: "Valiant keep stands as a highly disconnected possession of the Aldresian order. It is not outwardly threatening to our position though it tends to stir up conflict between the local rulers on the extent of the sovereignty of the keep. Since it was previously purchased and the order is fairly compromising in deals regarding territories it could perhaps be possible to buy the keep back."
verne_flavor_ace.47.a: "Offer them a reasonable bid"
verne_flavor_ace.47.b: "Generosity has never failed in deal making"

verne_flavor_ace.48.t: "An Offer For Valiant Keep"
verne_flavor_ace.48.d: "The lords of Verne have put forward an offer for the territory and castle surrounding valiant keep. They offer a fairly decent sum for the relief of a costly governance outside of our immediate protection."
verne_flavor_ace.48.a: "It is a reasonable bid"
verne_flavor_ace.48.b: "No the keep is to important"

verne_flavor_ace.49.t: "Valiant Keep Sale Scrapped"
verne_flavor_ace.49.d: "It seems despite our more than generous offers our bid for valiant keep has ended in rejection. Most of the paperwork and treaties necessary had been signed and though at the final negotiations it seems to have fallen through and the Aldresian delegation left."
verne_flavor_ace.49.a: "Damn them take the drafts and insist they signed"


verne_flavor_ace.50.t: "Choosing The New Seat of Dameria"
verne_flavor_ace.50.d: "Through back breaking and infuriating diplomacy we have finally managed to coalesce the different bickering states that emerged from the fall of Dameria in the lilac wars. These states now are amicable to the return of a formal grand duchy of Dameria shepherded by close connections with our court. Though the question of where the new capital shall be hasn't ripped apart the agreement it has elicited many bribes and offers of favors which can prove helpful."
verne_flavor_ace.50.a: "We could have something to learn from the marshals of the Empire"
verne_flavor_ace.50.b: "The Mages would prove great allies in Dameria"
verne_flavor_ace.50.c: "The Elves would appreciate an uplifted position"
verne_flavor_ace.50.d1: "Protecting the smaller Princes could help our image"

verne_flavor_ace.51.t: "Reorganizing the Grand Duchy of Wex"
verne_flavor_ace.51.d: "The defeat and deposition of the antagonistic Wexonard powers has left a serious rupture within the empire. The states being leaderless and being isolated has left all remaining Wexonard nobles terrified at the threat of further partitions or conquests of their realms. These circumstances have allowed for a delegation to sound out a potential unification of the grand duchy of Wex’s territories. This move will distance our original intention of ending illegal Wexonard occupations and anger princes but is the best chance to control this crucial part of the borders."
verne_flavor_ace.51.a: "Bal Hyl can lead the new duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.51.b: "The court in Sugamber have better dynastic claims to prop up the duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.51.c: "The Bisanese are rugged and loyal to the imperial cause"


verne_flavor_ace.52.t: "Unifying the Borders"
verne_flavor_ace.52.d: "The eastern borders have been some of the most unsupervised and fractious parts of the empire, hardly a good status for one of our points of invasion. Before this problem could potentially emerge a new entity is being promulgated into law that should unify the governance and resources of the borders. The issues with administering and forming this duchy have gone smoothly except with the decision of where to designate the capital as many different locations have offered a great deal of promise and enticements."
verne_flavor_ace.52.a: "Arannen shall lead the borders again"
verne_flavor_ace.52.b: "The síl Vivins of Ashfield bring a curious offer"
verne_flavor_ace.52.c: "Perhaps one of the ports of the highcliff would do better"
verne_flavor_ace.52.d1: "Tellum is a proper capital city for our grandest march"



verne_flavor_ace.53.t: "Anbennarian Dostanor"
verne_flavor_ace.53.d: "Formulating the divisions of new land to the empire can be a tedious and nightmarish task depending on how the territory was acquired. Doing this to a region the size of Dostanor whilst also integrating it further into imperial law as a grand duchy has proven much worse. Differing nobles of the region have offered their services and support for the reform though all seem to demand that their court be the new capital and be allowed to administer the grand duchy. Without the support of one of the factions our bureaucrats will likely work themselves into an early death and with generous deals it may be worthwhile to take an offer."
verne_flavor_ace.53.a: "The Korbarids offer a somewhat sinister deal..."
verne_flavor_ace.53.b: "Bal Ouord Stands in the way of any invasion"
verne_flavor_ace.53.c: "Nathalaire could do well to rebuild the flooded coast"

verne_flavor_ace.54.t: "The Status of Vertesk"
verne_flavor_ace.54.d: "Vertesk and its grand Castanorian citadel lie at the very typo of the Damescrown and as such potential talks of a greater Damescrown state have questioned whether it should be included or not. Its connections with the Alenic peoples and its squabbling between the various minor eastern Damescrown countries who typically unite against Alenic encroachment have led to thinkers pointing at practical problems at a potential union. Now however the time for union has come and Vertesk’s future must be decided to be with its fellow Alens or with its commercial partners in the Dameshead."
verne_flavor_ace.54.a: "They are clearly meant to be a part of the Damescrown"
verne_flavor_ace.54.b: "Perhaps their destiny lies elsewhere"

verne_flavor_ace.55.t: "The Formation of the Dameshead Duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.55.d: "Amongst the cutthroat merchants of the Dameshead the ceremony and competition surrounding the potential future capital has been more blatant and unsubtle. The Dameshead duchy will help to reinvest the massive profits of the Dameshead into the duchy at large and likely the capital with trade routes likely changing from this. For the commercial city states of the Dameshead it can be the largest upset in the balance of power of the region in their favor for quite some time and as such are very vocal about what they can provide if given the privilege."
verne_flavor_ace.55.a: "The Black tower shall lead the duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.55.b: "The merchants of the Dameshead feel at home in Damescrown"
verne_flavor_ace.55.c: "The Imperial mint is a bastion of our authority"
verne_flavor_ace.55.d1: "Crothàns lawyers once again build a good argument"


verne_flavor_ace.56.t: "Squabbles over Telgeir"
verne_flavor_ace.56.d: "In the delegation of overturning centuries of imperial tradition and building grand duchies in the eastern half of the empire rather unexpected problem has emerged. The county of Telgeir has been in previous iterations considered part of the old kingdom of Esmaria and the concept surrounding the old defunct title of grand duchy of Esmaria. Commercially however Telgeir is very integrated and linked with the Damescrown princes who throw considerable influence in attempting to win over the famed armorers against the Esmari prince’s. The squabbling over the Vanbury’s fiefdom has become a major roadblock in finalizing the future Esmari and Damescrown grand duchies though the house of Vanbury also holds ties elsewhere that can be prioritized."
verne_flavor_ace.56.a: "Telgir's connections to the Dameshead are shown clear"
verne_flavor_ace.56.b: "They are a long standing part of the old kingdom of Esmaria and shall remain so"
verne_flavor_ace.56.c: "Telegir's claims directs it elsewhere ..."

verne_flavor_ace.57.t: "Restoring the Grand Duchy of Esmaria"
verne_flavor_ace.57.d: "Esmaria stands at the heart of the empire with only the isolationist Elves of Ibevar serving as non imperial neighbors. It stands as one of the most prosperous regions of the empire fed by the grand river Esmar where river barges flaunt Esmaria’s wealth. It stands as one of the most logical grand duchies to create with its pseudo status already being law it only needs a proper capital to be established where many bids exist amongst the wealthy statelets."
verne_flavor_ace.57.a: "Themarenn's exclusive river barges should be welcome to the Emperor"
verne_flavor_ace.57.b: "The great works of Balgar still mean something in Silverforge"
verne_flavor_ace.57.c: "Esmari's riverways coalesce into Estallen nicely"
verne_flavor_ace.57.d1: "Giberd would be a great partner with its innovations in artificery"


verne_flavor_ace.58.t: "Proclaiming the Small Duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.58.d: "The incorporation of the small country into the empire must not represent the imperialist hold that Gawed and Lorent held over the land. To truly ensure that the halflings don't revolt and stay content in the empire we must continue their representation either through the electorate of Beepeck or through a newly promoted prince that the halflings trust."
verne_flavor_ace.58.a: "The halfling elector is best suited to lead the new duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.58.b: "A loyal prince shall lead this new duchy"

verne_flavor_ace.59.t: "The Elves of Silverwood"
verne_flavor_ace.59.d: "Throughout the empire there exists many minority groups of elves though in the landing spot of Munas and the surrounding Silverwood they have established a much firmer presence. In the building of an elven grand duchy the question has appeared on whether these lands should be included so that the duchy may protect the sizable population of elves within the region. The detached lump of territory would be a significant source of inefficiency in imperial governance but elves of Silverwood would be better represented in the empire along with strengthening the duchy by providing it with a prosperous region and port."
verne_flavor_ace.59.a: "They shall be a part of the new duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.59.b: "It would be impractical to administer"

verne_flavor_ace.60.t: "The Capital of the Elfrealm"
verne_flavor_ace.60.d: "The elves of the empire exist in disparate and divided groups and have oftentimes been slowly made into minorities in their lands. As such when drafting plans of an eleven grand duchy the only real sensible lands that can work for its heartland exist in the west across Arbaran into and Ibevar. Here lies the old center of Cannorian Elfrealms, although Arbaran has long since abandoned this status. Ibevar meanwhile remained a isolationist realm and the Silent Repose has housed the oldest Elves in all of Cannor. Choosing a senior member amongst these three could prove challenging though necessary to ensure that the duchy may function."
verne_flavor_ace.60.a: "Ibevar has been the center of Cannorian Elves for some time now"
verne_flavor_ace.60.b: "As one of the Empires Marches Arbaran shall be rewarded"
verne_flavor_ace.60.c: "The Silent Repose is an uncontroversial candidate"

verne_flavor_ace.61.t: "The Western Border"
verne_flavor_ace.61.d: "The security of the western half of the Dameshead has been neglected for some time. To truly protect the region from the threats of Winelords it should be necessary to unite the west Damerians into a western march. Together they will be able to more successfully defend themselves though the direction of the march will likely be3 decided on where their capital will be."
verne_flavor_ace.61.a: "The Marquis of Wesdam shall make the western frontier secure"
verne_flavor_ace.61.b: "A real gesture to bury the hatchet with Pearlsedge could be beneficial"
verne_flavor_ace.61.c: "The Imperial navy in Neckcliffe will be needed in campaigns in the west"

verne_flavor_ace.62.t: "Formation of the Lencenor Duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.62.d: "Centuries of conflict with the descendants of Lorenan finally seem to be at an end. The power of Lorent has finally been broken and in its place better partners and princes emerged in Lencenor. We must solidify our gains and properly inaugurate our triumph over Lorent by proclaiming Lencenor to be a part of the empire proper as a grand duchy."
verne_flavor_ace.62.a: "The hereditary enemy ... dismantled"

verne_flavor_ace.63.t: "The Claims of Telgeir"
verne_flavor_ace.63.d: "The house of Vanbury that rules over the county of Telgeir was banished from their position as lords in Gawed centuries ago. This claim is still contemptuously held by the Vanbury though it has long since been considered void though it could realistically be revived in order to bring legitimacy to a Anbennarian occupation of the Alen and eventual restructuring."
verne_flavor_ace.63.a: "Their presence in the region will offer some stability"
verne_flavor_ace.63.b: "The administrative burden of such a disconnection is to much"

verne_flavor_ace.64.t: "The Status of Vertesk"
verne_flavor_ace.64.d: "Vertesk and its grand Castanorian citadel lie at the very typo of the Damescrown and as such potential talks of a greater Damescrown state have questioned whether it should be included or not. Its connections with the Alenic peoples and its squabbling between the various minor eastern Damescrown countries who typically unite against Alenic encroachment have led to thinkers pointing at practical problems at a potential union. Now however the time for union has come and Vertesk’s future must be decided to be with its fellow Alens or with its commercial partners in the Dameshead."
verne_flavor_ace.64.a: "The black tower of Vertesk will shadow the Alen"
verne_flavor_ace.64.b: "Perhaps their destiny lies elsewhere"

verne_flavor_ace.65.t: "Formation of the Alenic Duchy"
verne_flavor_ace.65.d: "The empire shall forever celebrate the triumph against the antagonistic Gawedi. However the victory has been some of the as part as we must now seek to administer the region. Properly fracturing and protecting the Alenics will allow no power to threaten the Damescrown or the new frontier again."
verne_flavor_ace.65.a: "Vertesk as the Empires principal Alenic member shall head it"
verne_flavor_ace.65.b: "The claims of Telgeir shall be restored"
verne_flavor_ace.65.c: "Perhaps a new prince should be elevated to the position"

verne_flavor_ace.66.t: "Governing the Sorrow"
verne_flavor_ace.66.d: "The title of king of Kheterata may only be given to the people of Kheterata though it hardly stops the scheming clergy of the region from attempting to claim the title themselves or to give it out as a quid pro quo for power. It wouldn't then be impossible to revive the subjugation of Khetarata that the old Damerian republic had through claiming the mandate ourselves or through a proxy. The latter condition will surely help in preventing the folly of the old Damerian dominion of Khetarata."
verne_flavor_ace.66.a: "Appointing a puppet king as de facto governor could work best"
verne_flavor_ace.66.b: "We shall claim the Mandate for ourselves"

verne_flavor_ace.68.t: "Crisis in Verne"
verne_flavor_ace.68.d: "What has started as a largely colonial protest to the authority of and high handed policy of the government in the colonies has garnered support amongst some of the meritrists. The rule of the seniorists has finally boiled over the anger of the different meritrists factions and have caused them to unite in revolt with the different exiles and rebels seeking greater liberties and power. Across the colonies armed bands of meritrists have risen and started to assault different government arsenals, forts and seniorist estates with reciprocal actions being taken by seniorists with the raising of private armies. The revolt has spread sporadically in the mainland where the seniorists have begun to start a vicious campaign to attempt to stop it independent of the crown. The capital for now however seems to be calm and supported by moderate and neutral factions. In this moment of peace the crown must take some sort of action to bring about order in this spiraling moment of turmoil."
verne_flavor_ace.68.a: "the upstart meritrists must be crushed and order restored"
verne_flavor_ace.68.b: "the seniorists have overstepped their privilege and overstepped for to long"

verne_flavor_ace.69.t: "End of The Verneman Civil War"
verne_flavor_ace.69.d: "What was originally thought to develop into a great civil and political disturbance surprised all spectators when the crisis in Verne erupted into civil war. The destruction wrought across the colonies and the mainland has been catastrophic for the wellbeing of all within Verne and has spared not even the furthest and most remote regions. It seems the bloodshed and destruction has finally sobered up the majority of the combatants and capitulated the radical factions seeking to prolong the conflict. Different rebel groups are now being disbanded and now the crisis will hopefully dissipate with some time for the nation to heal as well."
verne_flavor_ace.69.a: "The Aristocracy endures again"
verne_flavor_ace.69.b: "To a new age of freedom"
verne_flavor_ace.69.c: "Perhaps we can look towards healing the nation..."

verne_flavor_ace.70.t: "Seniorists Rally"
verne_flavor_ace.70.d: "Recent efforts of the Seniorists have succeeded in building and raising a significant army. It seems the previously aloof nobles are now committed against the meritrists and seek to join the greater reaction against them."
verne_flavor_ace.70.a: "Ashen skies"

verne_flavor_ace.71.t: "Meritrists Rally"
verne_flavor_ace.71.d: "A previously distraught band of adventurers and exiles seemed to have finally snapped and taken a side in the civil war. They have gathered disgruntled and denied aspiring noblemen and coerced garrisons to join them in fomenting revolt."
verne_flavor_ace.71.a: "Ashen skies"

verne_flavor_ace.72.t: "Mass Desertions"
verne_flavor_ace.72.d: "The destruction seen amongst the Vernmen country side and general fear of happenings at home have prompted a large round of desertions amongst our ranks. It seems that this trend had started amongst a few regiments that couldn't be coerced in extending their service with other regiments joining out of jealousy or near expirations of their own contracts."
verne_flavor_ace.72.a: "We must get a grip on the country"

verne_flavor_ace.73.t: "Imperial Non Commitment"
verne_flavor_ace.73.d: "The civil war that has raged in Verne has thankfully largely stayed within the territories of the crown of Verne. This situation has however caused many within imperial courts and the parliament to declare the issue as one that must be dealt with the emperor's own resources. This stunning defiance of imperial will has caused a great setback for our efforts in the war and our overtures of help in it."
verne_flavor_ace.73.a: "Cant they see this involves them as well"

verne_flavor_ace.74.t: "Imperial Parliament Grants Aid"
verne_flavor_ace.74.d: "The imperial diet has recently decided to respect our calls for levies in our calls to reclaim our revolting territories. This has needed a lot of political clout to accomplish but not as much as it could have been for what has been offered by the parliament."
verne_flavor_ace.74.a: "Never has a tax return been more needed"

verne_flavor_ace.75.a: "Some good news for once"

verne_flavor_ace.76.t: "Charismatic Leader Foments Revolts"
verne_flavor_ace.76.d: "A relatively quiet region has now been incited to revolt due to largely the influence of a previously neutral figure. The revolt might be able to be subsided though as it seems he is not ideologically committed and is instead revolting to try and claw some power and influence from the movement. If we were perhaps able to offer him a better deal it could prevent the rabble rouser from stirring the revolt."

verne_flavor_ace.78.d: "It seems one of the members of our council has been in a slight bit of a decline. His work has been increasingly sloppy and of lesser quality whilst his participation in council has been poor at best. His performance has now put into question his soundness for holding his post though he still has many allies in the government asking that he be kept around."
verne_flavor_ace.78.a: "An excellent opportunity to have some new talent"
verne_flavor_ace.78.b: "These offices require finesse and tact to handle"

verne_flavor_ace.79.t: "Death of a Landholder"
verne_flavor_ace.79.d: "It seems that the recent passing of a prominent landowner has caused some serious issues regarding his inheritance. At the time of his passing his options for heirs are unclear, estranged and not mentioned in his hastily posted will. As such his large estate will find itself in the hands of the state and what to do with it has taken a better part of cabinet debates these last few days."

A33_adventury_republic_reform_desc: "The final hues of the old Vernmen nobility had birthed a new form of government.

Their gambit proved successful but the monkey's paw had twisted and the nature of the order is constantly in a flux. Factions have entrenched themselves in attempts to sway the balance either way with the Meritrists attempting to make a more qualified and inclusive noble court. The Seniorists will instead try and continue to preserve the exclusivity of nobility and older aristocratic order as well as privileges from their core base of older nobility."
