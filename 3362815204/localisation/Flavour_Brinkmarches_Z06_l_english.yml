flavor_brinkmarches.1.t: "Preventing a Sucession Crisis."
flavor_brinkmarches.1.d: "Walter V Brinkwick, has gotten old. Spending his entire life in the service of Arannen and doing his duty as the protector of the eastern border, this has caused him to be a bit of a recluse. He has no children, and the throne of Brinkmarches is in danger of falling into opportunist hands. The loyal court has decided to take action and find a suitable heir to the throne."
flavor_brinkmarches.1.a: "An brilliant young orphan from the temples."
flavor_brinkmarches.1.b: "An young son from an influential merchant family."
flavor_brinkmarches.1.c: "The youngest son from one of the noble houses."
flavor_brinkmarches.1.e: "Send letters to Varaine! The House of Brinkwick will live on!"

flavor_brinkmarches.2.t: "Petition the Marquis"
flavor_brinkmarches.2.d: "Arannen has begun their reclamation of the Daravan's Folly. As their loyal march, we should partition them about taking over the reclamation duty, so Arannen can focus on other affairs, while we fight the beasts of the swamp."
flavor_brinkmarches.2.a: "Let us make our case."

flavor_brinkmarches.3.t: "Brinkmarches requests colonization efforts"

flavor_brinkmarches.4.d: "Arannen has accepted our request to reclaim the folly in their stead and has also decided to fund the expeditions."
flavor_brinkmarches.4.a: "Cool"

flavor_brinkmarches.5.t: "Arannen Declines"
flavor_brinkmarches.5.d: "Arannen has declined our request to reclaim the folly in their stead. They are clearly not thinking straight. We should take matters into our own hands."
flavor_brinkmarches.5.a: "So you have chosen death"

flavor_brinkmarches.6.t: "Tough Love"
flavor_brinkmarches.6.d: "The confused rulers of Arannen have been taught a lesson. They have been forced to accept our demands and have agreed to help us reclaim the folly."
flavor_brinkmarches.6.a: "Hopefully they have seen the error of their ways."

flavor_brinkmarches.7.t: "Strange Encounter"
flavor_brinkmarches.7.d: "While clearing Wisphollow to make way for a new settlement, we encountered something most unexpected. A group of Flamemarked Gnolls approached our camp—not in the usual fury of battle, but calmly, without weapons, and speaking in Common. They claimed to have been exiled from the other Gnoll tribes and had made their home in the depths of Wisphollow. What was even more unusual was their reverence for a being they called the Wispking, a mysterious figure they say protects them."
flavor_brinkmarches.7.a: "The Wispking, eh?"

flavor_brinkmarches.8.t: "An Unusual Tutor"
flavor_brinkmarches.8.d: "Our heir has taken a peculiar interest in Wisphollow, often seen observing the Flamemarked Gnolls as they train, hunt, and live their lives. One of their leaders, a respected figure among them, has taken a liking to the young noble and begun mentoring him. While unconventional, these lessons have proven valuable—our heir is gaining a unique perspective on discipline, survival, and leadership, all through the lens of Gnollish tradition."
flavor_brinkmarches.8.a: "A Gnoll tutoring a human, who would have thought?"

flavor_brinkmarches.9.t: "No where to be seen"
flavor_brinkmarches.9.d: "Our heir has once again visited the Gnoll settlement in Wisphollow, as he has done faithfully for months—but this time, he did not return. Concerned, we dispatched search parties immediately. Strangely, we have also learned that Pouk, the Gnollish leader who mentored our heir, has vanished as well. Day and night, our men scour the woods and hills of Wisphollow, but so far, not a single trace of either has been found."
flavor_brinkmarches.9.a: "We can only assume the worst"

flavor_brinkmarches.10.t: "Miracle!"
flavor_brinkmarches.10.d1: "A talented mage has appeared at our court, claiming to have found our missing heir deep in the wilderness, covered in blood but alive. He says he cared for the boy and brought him back to health. Strangely, our heir insists he was never in danger, speaking calmly and offering no details of what happened. There’s something unsettling in his eyes—something changed. But he swears he is fine."
flavor_brinkmarches.10.d2: "A talented mage has come before us, claiming to have found our lost ruler deep in the wilderness, covered in blood and alone. He says he took him in, cared for him, and ensured his safety. Strangely, our ruler insists he was never in danger, brushing off all concern. Though unharmed, there’s something different in his demeanor—calm, distant, and oddly certain."
flavor_brinkmarches.10.a: "Wow! Give him a court position!"

flavor_brinkmarches.11.t: "Tutor Sessions"
flavor_brinkmarches.11.d: "The court mage Pock, who has aided us greatly, has taken a keen interest in tutoring our ruler. His guidance has been wise, offering sound advice on governance and leadership. In his lessons, he often tells tales of the Daravan's Folly and its storied past. Strangely, he has also spoken of the Wispking—just as the Gnolls of Wisphollow once did. The coincidence is unsettling."
flavor_brinkmarches.11.a: "Pock offers great advise."

flavor_brinkmarches.12.t: "Tragedy!"
flavor_brinkmarches.12.d: "It was a day like any other. Our ruler met with Pock, the court mage, behind closed doors. An hour passed, then two. When no word came from within, the guards knocked—no response. They forced the door open, only to find our ruler slumped over the table—alive, but unconscious, unresponsive to any attempts to wake him. Pock was gone, vanished without a trace. Despite a full search of the castle, he could not be found. Our ruler remains ill, and a shadow of fear hangs heavy over the court."
flavor_brinkmarches.12.a: "How could this happen!?"

flavor_brinkmarches.13.t: "Nothing ever happens"
flavor_brinkmarches.13.d: "While the court doctors continued their examination, our ruler suddenly awoke. To everyone’s surprise, he seemed perfectly healthy—no signs of illness or weakness. In fact, he appeared stronger, more focused, almost... renewed. He insists that nothing is wrong, and that he is ready to return to his duties at once. Despite the mystery, our ruler has resumed leadership, more determined than ever."
flavor_brinkmarches.13.a: "What a relief!"

flavor_brinkmarches.14.t: "Healing the Folly"
flavor_brinkmarches.14.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] summoned the entire court to Wisphollow, where he stood alongside a circle of Gnolls. There, he announced that the Gnolls had discovered a way to heal the Folly and that, together, they would restore the land. Mages were ordered to aid in the ritual, though none recognized the spell being cast. As the Gnolls began to chant and dance, an eerie magic filled the air, unsettling all present. A thick fog rose and blanketed the grove.\n\nWhen it cleared, all were on their knees, paralyzed and mute—save for one: [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Before the stunned crowd, he revealed his true identity—Puck, the Wispking of legend. Disguised first as Pouk, the exiled Gnoll; then as Pock, the trusted court mage; and finally as the ruler of Brinkmarches himself, he had woven a long game of deception. The ritual was not for healing, but domination. Now, the court is bound to his will, the Gnolls serve as his loyal agents, and the realm falls under the rule of Puck, the Wispking, returned from shadow to exact his revenge."
flavor_brinkmarches.14.a: "A scheme centuries in the making."

flavor_brinkmarches.16.t: "Diplomatic Incident"
flavor_brinkmarches.16.d: "Rumors spread that an unknown Arannese diplomat traveled to Corvuria and gravely insulted its rulers, causing a major diplomatic scandal. The situation quickly spiraled, and relations between Arannen and Corvuria collapsed. Though the diplomat was arrested, they somehow escaped custody and vanished without a trace. Tensions now run high, and the damage to the alliance may be permanent."
flavor_brinkmarches.16.a: "Huh.."

flavor_brinkmarches.17.t: "Restoration"
flavor_brinkmarches.17.d: "Assuming the mantle of ruler over Brinkmarches, Puck has launched ruthless campaigns against neighboring realms of both the Empire and Corvuria. His true goal: to restore his ancient kingdom, within the borders it once held before he was deceived by Nerat's avatar and cursed into a wandering wisp, bound to the twisted lands of Daravan’s Folly. Now, the time has come. Puck casts off his disguises and reveals his true form. Puck has returned — and his realm rises once more."
flavor_brinkmarches.17.a: "Hail King Puck"

flavor_brinkmarches.18.t: "Puck's Revenge"
flavor_brinkmarches.18.d: "Long ago, when Puck ruled vast stretches of the borders, he was betrayed by Nerat's avatar—tricked into following a lone, flickering wisp deep into the heart of the swamp. There, in the cursed mists, he was ensnared and transformed into a wisp himself, doomed to wander the Folly for centuries. But now, Puck has returned. With the Necropolis—Nerat's sacred monument—under his control, he finally holds the power to exact his long-awaited revenge. The Wispking rises, and his vengeance begins."
flavor_brinkmarches.18.a: "All that will be left are ashes."

flavor_brinkmarches.19.t: "Submission"
flavor_brinkmarches.19.d: "With all preparations complete, the moment has arrived. A ritual, ancient and twisted, mirroring the one Puck once used to ensnare the court, is now to be unleashed upon the entire realm. As the final words of the incantation echo through the air, a wave of eerie fog rolls across the land. The skies darken, and the very air hums with raw, oppressive magic. Across towns and villages, people fall still—eyes glazed, minds clouded. Resistance fades as the will of Puck seeps into every heart. The rebellion is silenced, and the realm kneels. Puck's dominion is absolute."
flavor_brinkmarches.19.a: "They realize the benevelence of King Puck."

flavor_brinkmarches.20.t: "The Veil of Puck"
flavor_brinkmarches.20.d: "A mysterious cult has begun to take root within our lands — calling themselves the Veil of Puck. They worship Puck not just as a ruler, but as a god of illusions, dreams, and hidden truths. Cloaked in secrecy and speaking in riddles, they whisper his name in reverence and spread his doctrine in shadow. Their numbers grow with each passing day, reaching into the hearts of cities and courts alike. Puck does not interfere — for with every prayer and offering, his influence deepens. Let them worship, for in doing so, they bind themselves tighter to his will."
flavor_brinkmarches.20.a: "Puck sees all. Puck knows all."

flavor_brinkmarches.21.t: "The Journey Home"
flavor_brinkmarches.21.d: "With the portal to the Feyrealm shimmering before him, Puck knew the time had come. This had always been his true goal — to return home, to the place of his origin, and seek out the ones who had left him behind: his parents.\n\nHe stood at the threshold, cloaked in the strange, dreamlike energy of the portal, casting one last look over the realm he had ruled — a land shaped by his will, illusions, and vengeance. Then, without a word, he stepped through.\n\nThe portal closed behind him in a whisper of wind and fading light. The air fell still. The Wispking was gone, and silence reigned."
flavor_brinkmarches.21.a: "...Now what?"

flavor_brinkmarches.22.t: "Anarchy"
flavor_brinkmarches.22.d: "As Puck vanished into the Feyrealm, the invisible chains that had bound the realm’s people to his will began to loosen. The oppressive fog of magic that had once clouded their thoughts lifted, and the inhabitants of the land slowly regained their freedom. For the first time in years, they could think clearly, act freely, and voice their dissent.\n\nRebellion began to brew like a storm across the land. The court, once puppets of Puck, now stood at odds with each other. Former loyalists scrambled for power, seeking to control what was left of the kingdom. Those who had long suffered under Puck’s rule rallied, determined to reclaim their independence and restore what had been taken from them."
flavor_brinkmarches.22.a: "Puck has abandoned us!"

flavor_brinkmarches.23.t: "Return of the King"
flavor_brinkmarches.23.d: "As Puck steps forth from the Fey portal, the realm falls into a stunned silence. The flickering fires of rebellion, the shouts of the defiant, the chaos of the moment all seem to freeze in place. The world around him bends to his will, the air thick with a palpable tension as magic surges through the land. He stands like an ancient god reborn, an undeniable force whose very presence commands submission.\n\nHis eyes glow with the power of the Feyrealm, the essence of his true self now fully awakened. No longer the wisp that had been tricked and exiled, but a king with the strength to mold reality to his desires. The tremors in the earth are not of fear, but of reverence — for the land itself remembers him, and the people now understand that the true ruler has returned.\n\nWith a single gesture, the magic ripples outward. The rebels, frozen mid-sentence, halt in their tracks. Their bodies no longer obey their own will, and their voices die in their throats. They are not slain, but they are bound — stilled by the overwhelming power of Puck’s magic. The land has no choice but to kneel before him.\n\n With a wave of his hand, the rebels are lifted from their frozen stasis, their bodies compelled to kneel before him, their resistance gone, their minds clouded with the magic of the Fey. The flames of revolt die down as the people fall into line, not through fear alone, but through the enchantment of Puck's absolute control."
flavor_brinkmarches.23.a: "The Forever Ruler"
flavor_brinkmarches.23.b: "Unleash the full might of the Feyrealm!"

flavor_brinkmarches.24.t: "The role of the Wispsworn"
flavor_brinkmarches.24.d: "The Wispsworn Gnolls have served Puck for a long time, and they were the center piece of his plan to infiltrate Brinkmarches. They have proven their loyalty and strength, and now it is time to reward them. We must decide how to utilize their skills in our realm."
flavor_brinkmarches.24.a: "They will serve as the vanguard of our armies."
flavor_brinkmarches.24.b: "They will serve as auxeliaries to our armies."
flavor_brinkmarches.24.c: "They will be the backbone of our realm."

flavor_brinkmarches.25.t: "The Realm Beyond"
flavor_brinkmarches.25.d: "With the Portal opened, we are able to send expeditions to the other side, to explore the lands beyond."
flavor_brinkmarches.25.a: "Forward"

flavor_brinkmarches.26.t: "Secrets of the Deepwoods"
flavor_brinkmarches.26.d: "Through investigation and exploration, we have discovered that the Deepwoods hide a powerful secret—a portal to the Feyrealm, dormant yet pulsing with arcane energy. Puck, ever drawn to such mysteries, has taken a deep interest in this revelation.\n\nTo fully awaken and control the portal, we must seize the surrounding provinces rich in magical essence. These lands are not just strategic—they are vital."

flavor_brinkmarches.27.t: "Squatters of the woods"
flavor_brinkmarches.27.d: "King Puck has returned home, and with him comes the promise of a new era. The Deepwoods, once a realm of chaos and conflict, will now be reshaped under his rule. But first the new inhabitants have to be dealt with."

flavor_brinkmarches.1003.t: "More rebellions against the Tyrant Puck"
flavor_brinkmarches.1003.d: "The peasants of our realm do not want to accept being ruled by an Fey, and their discontent grows by the day."
