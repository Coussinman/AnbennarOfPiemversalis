lizard_precursor_relics: "Discovery of ancient Zatsarya!"
lizard_precursor_relics_desc: "An ancient Zatsarya with untouched Precursor Lizardfolk inventions was discovered when artifact hunters detected a strange magical resonance in the abandoned ruins. The petrified gates yielded only after complex seal decoding by artificers from Shangra. Inside, mechanisms appeared as if left just yesterday—intricate artifacts glowing dimly and a mysterious monolith. Many devices remain functional, yet their purpose is lost. Researchers cautiously study the find, realizing that the Zatsarya could redefine the understanding of the Lizardfolk legacy."

lizard_damestear: "The Nagas have summoned the Damestear!"
lizard_damestear_desc: "Deep within the star-lit sanctum of Shalazar, naga mages perform the "Invocation of the Astral Vein." Gathered beneath an ancient celestial map, they align their magic with the movements of the heavens, tracing constellations in shimmering stardust. At the ritual’s peak, the High Priest carves a path through the cosmic veil, drawing forth a stream of Damestir—a crystallized essence of pure stellar energy. If properly contained within enchanted sigils, the Damestir flows endlessly, fueling spells and arcane forges. But a single misstep could unravel the fabric of space, consuming the summoners in an astral maelstrom."

If we accept, our armies will not only grow stronger, but we will take the first step toward avenging our lost lands. \nWill we embrace their legacy and forge an army guided by the wisdom of the Feathers of Ma’at?
