skaldhyrric_faith: "Skaldhyrric Faith"
skaldhyrric_faith_religion_desc: "Founded during the Dragonwake, the Skaldhyrric Faith is the dominant religion of Gerudia. They believe that reciting magical tales keeps Elkaesal the White, the dragon that plunged Gerudia into eternal winter, sleeping and at bay."
ace_the_dragon_and_the_skald: "§YThe Dragon and the Skald§!"
desc_ace_the_dragon_and_the_skald: "The foremost tale in the Skaldhyrric Faith, The Dragon and the Skald retells the origin of the faith itself. Long ago in the fifth century, Gerudia fell into a deep winter due to a monstrous dragon known as Elkaesel the White. A brave one-armed Skald selflessly ventured to face the beast, and sang it to sleep. Ever since then, the Skaldhyrric Faith has recited this tale to remind everyone of their history and how much it depends on the Skalds.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YSkaldic Fervor§! modifier, giving §G+10% church power§! for 10 years."
ace_voyage_of_the_north_raider: "§YVoyage of the North Raider§!"
desc_ace_voyage_of_the_north_raider: "A grand tale of an adventure at sea, the Voyage of the North Raider is a favorite of explorers looking for new lands. The story tells of a vessel called the North Raider that was wildly blown off course. For weeks the crew were lost at sea, and then found themselves in a virgin land full of riches. They returned home with bounties of treasure, but alas, they could never find their way back to the land of riches.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YGerudian Settlers§! modifier, giving §G+15% colonial range§! for 10 years."
ace_beralic_saga: "§YBeralic Saga§!"
desc_ace_beralic_saga: "Bera was the founder of the Kingdom of Bjarnrík, first an acclaimed Reaver and then the uniter of the Dalr Valley. The Beralic Saga recounts the tale of her return home, when she drove out the Trolls that had plagued her homeland. With the united forces of the Dalric jarls and the Skalds, Bera defeated Urgnak the Foul, forever banishing the Trolls to the Dalrfjall Mountains.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YSons of Bera§! modifier, giving §G+5% infantry combat ability§! for 10 years."
ace_dirge_of_the_deep: "§YDirge of the Deep§!"
desc_ace_dirge_of_the_deep: "A somber, but inspiring, tale, the Dirge of the Deep is a retelling of the fallen heroes of Gerudia that were buried at sea. The Dirge often takes place at funeral services, but it also can be found in the mead halls where grown, hardy, Reavers turn their head in sadness.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YGlory Awaits§! modifier, giving §G+1 naval combat bonus off owned coast§! for 10 years."
ace_treasure_of_the_golden_forest: "§YTreasure of the Golden Forest§!"
desc_ace_treasure_of_the_golden_forest: "A legend originating in Naugsvol, the Treasure of the Golden Forest is a cautionary tale about the pursuit of wealth. The Golden Forest is a mythical glade, said to be past the Titan's Rest Mountains, full of treasure in jewels, fur and gold. Many an adventurer has set off to find this forest, but none have ever found it. Throughout the mountain passes frozen corpses are found, a testament to the elusiveness of the forest. The tale of the Golden Forest is told to warn those of aspirations of wealth not to take too great a risk.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, our capital will gain §G+10% goods produced modifier§! for 10 years."
ace_the_old_winter_lullaby: "§YThe Old Winter Lullaby§!"
desc_ace_the_old_winter_lullaby: "A favourite among new parents, the Old Winter Lullaby is a soothing song that puts even the most rowdy of infants to sleep. Oddly, the Lullaby is spoken in a language few but the Skalds understand, in a menacing and guttural tone. Some even speculate that this is the exact tale that the unknown Skald of legend sang to the Dragon in order to bring it to slumber.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YGerudia Weeps§! modifier, giving §G+1 attrition for enemies§! for 10 years."
ace_gjalund_and_the_giantslayers: "§YGjalund and the Giantslayers§!"
desc_ace_gjalund_and_the_giantslayers: "A tale that predates even the Dragon and the Skald. Long ago, when the Giants walked the earth, few dared to oppose them. Gjalund, however, took up his axe and slew many of the Giants himself, and inspired many to follow in his stead. However, Gjalund's story came to its end when the mighty Dragon started its horrid winter. With his most fearless warriors, Gjalund froze to death while camping in the skull of a dead giant.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain §G15§! army tradition."
ace_master_boat_builders_of_far_gerudia_beyond: "§YMaster Boat Builders§!"
desc_ace_master_boat_builders_of_far_gerudia_beyond: "Often recited by boatbuilders and sailors along the many coasts of Gerudia, the Master Boat Builders of Far Gerudia Beyond tells of an immense, ancient shipyard well past the frosted seas of Far Gerudia. This shipyard is said to be worked by small, pale figures dressed in warm furs, but the impressive part is the ships they produce. Huge longships with massive steel icebreakers are said to sail out of the shipyard, constructed of a wood never seen before.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain §G15§! navy tradition."
ace_tale_of_leif_snaketongue: "§YTale of Leiv Snaketongue§!"
desc_ace_tale_of_leif_snaketongue: "Leiv Snaketongue was an ordinary Gerudian, born in Redgarhavn many years ago. He was often overlooked, for he was not blessed with strength or courage in battle. What he was gifted in was the guile and convincing of his words. Leiv Snaketongue bought a vessel and recruited a crew, all in discount, of course, and set sail for the Alenic Frontier. There he encountered a strange city, named Celmaldor, inhabited by the Moon Elves, of all people. With the snake of his tongue, Leiv convinced the Elves to elect him as the leader of their republic.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YExploring the Limits§! modifier, giving §G-0.15 yearly corruption§! for 10 years."
ace_castan_ebonfrost: "§YThe Ebonfrost Epic§!"
desc_ace_castan_ebonfrost: "Some say that power is their birthright. That a crown is worn by those of a noble dynasty. That is nonsense: power is earned by those who seize it. The Castan Ebonfrost began his life as a lowly commoner in the backwaters of Urviksten, then a tributary of the waning Castanor. Gunnar Ebonfrost joined a reaver crew and made his living as through both tasks mundane and violent. The Ebonfrost grew in strength and glory over the years, contributing and leading raids and sacks across the Dameshead and Divenhal Sea. But his greatest adventure was the heist of Castanor itself: fooling them into accepting him as governor of Vrorenmarch, he tore his way through the soft Castanorians and crowned himself Castan."
ace_skcorin: "§YCorin's Sacrifice§!"
desc_ace_skcorin: "Like a tale of old, the young maid Corin slew the monstrous Korgus Dookanson. Although an Escanni, she has rightfully earned her glory, so much so that some proclaim her as a goddess. While her divinity is in doubt, her heroism is not. Both the heretics and traditionalists of the Regent Court have spun their own tales of gods and avatars: let us weave Corin's martyrdom into our own storybook to find common ground with them.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a Deus Vult CB on a random neighboring heathen country."
ace_elven_voyages: "§YElven Voyages§!"
desc_ace_elven_voyages: "Long have Gerudians sailed the seas for fame and fortune. From across the western seas the Elves have seduced and subjugated the Cannorians, and proved a vital blow against Black Castanor. Their voyages across the seas, tales of the long past, and political feuds have shaped the course of the past centuries. Pondered and scribed by the Skalds, accounts of Elven mythology and their feats are told throughout Gerudia.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain an §YElven Magnificence§! modifier, giving §G-10% idea cost§! for 10 years."
ace_ebonsteel: "§YEbonsteel Einherjar§!"
desc_ace_ebonsteel: "Behind every hero is their tool of trade. Axe and spear, shield and helm, horn and hammer - epic tales are forged through the craft of legendary smiths. From elden days, long before Elkaesal the White froze Gerudia, ancient Gerudians forged metal black as the night sky. Ebonsteel-clad warriors cleaved through lowly iron, shields withstood barrage, and mountains sculpted into statues in the Titan's Rest Mountains. The art of crafting Ebonsteel has all been lost, until now.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YBlack Steel, Daring Hearts§! modifier, giving §G-10% land maintenance and +5% infanty combat ability§! for our Ebonsteel Infantry regiments for 10 years."
ace_ambrstrond: "§YAnnals of Ambrströnd§!"
desc_ace_ambrstrond: "Discovering a new land across the western seas, Gerudians established the colony of Ambrströnd along the Hjora river. Called Dalaire by southerners, this land almost seemed like home: icy peaked mountains, vast expanses of pine forest, and winding fjords. But behind this welcoming facade were many strange dangers: hallucinogetic sap, wild magic permafrost, and the ever-watching Skraelings. The journals of the early colony were published back home in Gerudia, and proved popular as tales of swashbuckling adventure."
ace_olav: "§YThe First Gerudians§!"
desc_ace_olav: "Almost forgotten in myth, the tale of Urvik and Olav is old as the land itself. Leading their people north past the Jotuntars, Urvik founded the first Gerudian homestead in the Black Frost Mountains - Urviksten. Forging suits of armor and weapons of legend from ebonsteel, Urvik and his son Olav soon found themselves targets of the envious Trolls. Urvik's Rock was fiercely defended against the monstrous foe, and with ebonsteel blade and fire we drove the beasts all the way to the Dalr! Now a grown man himself, Olav succeeded his father and founded Olavsborg, and has been immortalized as the founding father of Olavlund.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YLessons of the First Gerudians§! modifier, giving §G+0.005% army professionalism§! for 10 years."
ace_gnomes: "§YFrom Thralls to Masters§!"
desc_ace_gnomes: "Harken to the tale of the small folk, the gnomes of the Dragon Coast! In the Age of Black Ice, they were brought to these lands as mere thralls, toiling beneath the gaze of their masters. But the wheel of fate turns, and so too did their fortunes. The sharp minds of the gnomes could not be ignored, and soon the jarls saw their worth. No longer mere servants, they rose to become majordomos and keepers of accounts, trusted in halls of power. This tale spreads hope among the young thralls and peons, for it shows that no man’s fate is carved in stone. Even the lowliest may rise, if their gifts find the right place and moment to shine.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YPlaces of Education§! modifier, giving §G+0.25 yearly innovativeness§! for 10 years."
ace_blue_reach: "§YMelt Church§!"
desc_ace_blue_reach: "Behold the Thednkerkja, the Melt Church, first raised in Coldmarket in the year 502. It is said to stand upon the very earth where the ice first surrendered its grip, when the dread Elkaesal fell into slumber. Thus, it is no wonder that Coldmarket holds the greatest number of Gerudians beyond their homeland, bound by frost and faith. This grand church stands as a living testament to the bond between our people and the hardy folk of Blue Reach, a symbol of shared blood and history, forged in the melting ice."
ace_anbenncost: "§YCity of Cities§!"
desc_ace_anbenncost: "Anbenncóst, the City of Unity, as the southerners call it, stands as the mightiest city in all the known world. No city of Gerudia — neither Bayvic nor Konungrhavn — can match its grandeur. Now, a new saga begins, written by our own hands. We are greater than Godrac the Invader, we surpass Ebonfrost achievements. We, the sons of Gerudia, shall forge a new age — the Age of Glory! Let the world remember our deeds, for we will carve our names into the stone of history, brighter and bolder than any before.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YHeart of Cannor§! modifier, giving §G+5% administrative efficiency§! for 10 years."
ace_harpies: "§YFrozen Feathers§!"
desc_ace_harpies: "Let it be known to everyone - Gerudia does not frown upon the strangers. Few centuries ago, a lonely flock of harpies sought refuge on the verges of Gerudian Frontier, escaping from the wrath of the southerners, but found only battle, beset by trollish raiders. With doom upon them, a Gerudian warband came to their aid, and together they drove back the trolls. In gratitude, the Harpies swore an oath to fight alongside the Gerudians, reclaiming the north from trolls and Elkaesal cultists. For the next few centuries, the harpies guided us in battle, outmaneuvering enemies and saving the wounded from a certain death, watching above from the skies. To this day, Járnklo Harpies watch over the warriors of Olavlund, rescuing heroes from the battlefield and carrying them to Vængheim, where their wounds are healed and their valor honored.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YHelp from Above§! modifier, giving §G-5% land attrition§! for 10 years."
ace_askel_reaverking: "§YTale of Reverians§!"
desc_ace_askel_reaverking: "In 825, Reaverking Askel arrived at Reaver’s Landing, seizing the northernmost provinces of the Kingdom of Iochand. With the gnomish help he would later execute a thoroughly-planned landing in the well-defending Gnomish Pass, controlled by alenic Kingdom of Eaglecrest. Alenics stood no chance and routed, and thus the Kingdom of Reveria was formed, operating as a safe port for all reavers on their way back to Gerudia.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain §Y20 spy network§! in every rival of us."
ace_derhilde_reaverqueen: "§YReaverqueen Legacy§!"
desc_ace_derhilde_reaverqueen: "Derhilde Reaverqueen conquered the West Lencenor as an act of revenge for her father, Reaverking Rangvald, defeated and killed in the initial invasion of 850. Eventually she had become High Queen of Lencenor for a short time after pillaging through the Lencori capital of Lorentei. Despite being pushed back to Deranne proper after Derhilde's death, her people managed to mix in with native Lencori, forging the Derannic culture, named after their Queen.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, our every subject will lose §Y10 liberty desire§!."
ace_halfdal_the_hoarder: "§YDivenhal Raiders§!"
desc_ace_halfdal_the_hoarder: "Halfdal Henriksson, the second son of the legendary Henrik Divenscourge, had ambitions to surpass the wealth and fame of his deceased father. Four years after the death of his father he called the other Reaver Kingdoms to arms and began the invasion of the last standing remnant of the Damerian Republic: the republic of Tef. A year after, the last Damerian holdouts surrendered, marking the proclamation of Reaver Kingdom of Divenhal Sea, the biggest naval powerhouse in Cannor, Mother's Sorrow and Bulwar. Halfdal Henriksson had fulfilled his ambitions.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain the §YAmbitions of Halfdal§! modifier, giving us §Y+25% available province loot§! for 10 years, making our raids more profitable."
ace_henrik_divenscourge: "§YImperial Reavers§!"
desc_ace_henrik_divenscourge: "Henrik Divenscourge was a Dalric reaver that founded the Kingdom of Pearlsedge in 879 after conquering the lands from the Tretunic Kingdom on his way back from Divenhal to Gerudia. His son Harald married local princess Andarta Tretunis, founding the Pearlman Dynasty, which would be one of the most prominent dynasties in imperial politics for the next millenia, while his second son Halfdal organized his own reaver fleet and went on to found the Divenhal Kingdom.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will lose §Y10 local autonomy§! in our every province."
ace_harpies_upgraded: "§YAge of Iron§!"
desc_ace_harpies_upgraded: "The Age of Iron is upon Cannor. Once refugees, Járnklo Harpies managed to achieve the unthinkable - not only their wisdom and battle prowess united Gerudia, fearsome Cannorian Great Powers bowed before them, one after one. Truly, a feat worthy the highest praises!"

favored_RC.400.t: "Favored by the Gods - The One-Armed Skald"
favored_RC.400.d: "Many worshippers of the Regent Court feel a close association with one member of the pantheon or another, but few live their lives as devotees of one deity before all others. Even among those that do, it is rare to find an individual whose character and deeds reflect their patron deity in their every action. Such individuals are sometimes called Emulants, and the priesthood of [Root.GetName] has noted that the great piousness, bravery, and attention to Tales of [Root.Monarch.GetName] may mark them as a chosen exemplar of The One-Armed Skald. Several clerics have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to recommend further religious devotion to specific aspects of the god, though there appears to be a split among the priests about which part of The One-Armed Skald's portfolio that we might dedicate our time to.\n\nSpending many of your waking hours in prayer, study, and ritual would take your focus from the direct administration of the realm and require the delegation of some important responsibilities, but could yield major spiritual enlightenment. Will you pursue the wisdom of the gods further, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
favored_RC.400.a: "I shall emulate The One-Armed Skald, who was braver than all."
favored_RC.400.b: "I shall emulate The One-Armed Skald, who listens to every Tale."
favored_RC.400.c: "I may be favored by Him, but I do not have the time for years of religious contemplation."
favored_RC.401.t: "Emulant - The Dragonluller"
favored_RC.401.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s quest to emulate The One-Armed Skald, who was braver than any man before or after Him, has been arduous at times, as most monarchs lead from the back and send others perform frightful tasks... But not [Root.Monarch.GetName]. When a werewolf was sighted in the area, it felt like a way to test your mettle.\n Scouring the keep for a silver blade, the gathering of potions and supplies, the travel to the woods where a beast has been reported, they required no bravery, but what was ahead certainly did; A werewolf the size of a horse, who has three dozen deaths to his name. Your bodyguards, the hired adventurers and the local guide all quake in fear, but you are the very definition of bravery, axe in hand you charge, a brave roar escapes your throat, your companions follow with newfound bravery of their own."
favored_RC.401.a: "We all have our own Elkaesal to defeat."
favored_RC.402.t: "Emulant - The First Skald"
favored_RC.402.d: "The One-Armed Skald, who after saving Gerudia could have stayed and ruled like the Deity He is, chose to leave, for He had other plans. The words of wisdom that He left us with teach us many lessons, one of which is that every tale is worth telling. As such we must try to accept those who think differently, so that we may hear their Tales, and our Skalds may learn what must be learned.\n\n [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been inviting minorities from across the realm, listening to their tales, understanding how their Tales shape them, just as yours have shaped you."
favored_RC.402.a: "Truly all Tales are worth telling."
