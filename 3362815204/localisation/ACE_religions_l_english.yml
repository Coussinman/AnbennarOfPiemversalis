skaldhyrric_faith: "Skaldhyrric Faith"
skaldhyrric_faith_religion_desc: "Founded during the Dragonwake, the Skaldhyrric Faith is the dominant religion of Gerudia. They believe that reciting magical tales keeps Elkaesal the White, the dragon that plunged Gerudia into eternal winter, sleeping and at bay."
ace_the_dragon_and_the_skald: "§YThe Dragon and the Skald§!"
desc_ace_the_dragon_and_the_skald: "The foremost tale in the Skaldhyrric Faith, The Dragon and the Skald retells the origin of the faith itself. Long ago in the fifth century, Gerudia fell into a deep winter due to a monstrous dragon known as Elkaesel the White. A brave one-armed Skald selflessly ventured to face the beast, and sang it to sleep. Ever since then, the Skaldhyrric Faith has recited this tale to remind everyone of their history and how much it depends on the Skalds.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YSkaldic Fervor§! modifier, giving §G+10% church power§! for 10 years."
ace_voyage_of_the_north_raider: "§YVoyage of the North Raider§!"
desc_ace_voyage_of_the_north_raider: "A grand tale of an adventure at sea, the Voyage of the North Raider is a favorite of explorers looking for new lands. The story tells of a vessel called the North Raider that was wildly blown off course. For weeks the crew were lost at sea, and then found themselves in a virgin land full of riches. They returned home with bounties of treasure, but alas, they could never find their way back to the land of riches.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YGerudian Settlers§! modifier, giving §G+15% colonial range§! for 10 years."
ace_beralic_saga: "§YBeralic Saga§!"
desc_ace_beralic_saga: "Bera was the founder of the Kingdom of Bjarnrík, first an acclaimed Reaver and then the uniter of the Dalr Valley. The Beralic Saga recounts the tale of her return home, when she drove out the Trolls that had plagued her homeland. With the united forces of the Dalric jarls and the Skalds, Bera defeated Urgnak the Foul, forever banishing the Trolls to the Dalrfjall Mountains.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YSons of Bera§! modifier, giving §G+5% infantry combat ability§! for 10 years."
ace_dirge_of_the_deep: "§YDirge of the Deep§!"
desc_ace_dirge_of_the_deep: "A somber, but inspiring, tale, the Dirge of the Deep is a retelling of the fallen heroes of Gerudia that were buried at sea. The Dirge often takes place at funeral services, but it also can be found in the mead halls where grown, hardy, Reavers turn their head in sadness.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YGlory Awaits§! modifier, giving §G+1 naval combat bonus off owned coast§! for 10 years."
ace_treasure_of_the_golden_forest: "§YTreasure of the Golden Forest§!"
desc_ace_treasure_of_the_golden_forest: "A legend originating in Naugsvol, the Treasure of the Golden Forest is a cautionary tale about the pursuit of wealth. The Golden Forest is a mythical glade, said to be past the Titan's Rest Mountains, full of treasure in jewels, fur and gold. Many an adventurer has set off to find this forest, but none have ever found it. Throughout the mountain passes frozen corpses are found, a testament to the elusiveness of the forest. The tale of the Golden Forest is told to warn those of aspirations of wealth not to take too great a risk.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, our capital will gain §G+10% goods produced modifier§! for 10 years."
ace_the_old_winter_lullaby: "§YThe Old Winter Lullaby§!"
desc_ace_the_old_winter_lullaby: "A favourite among new parents, the Old Winter Lullaby is a soothing song that puts even the most rowdy of infants to sleep. Oddly, the Lullaby is spoken in a language few but the Skalds understand, in a menacing and guttural tone. Some even speculate that this is the exact tale that the unknown Skald of legend sang to the Dragon in order to bring it to slumber.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YGerudia Weeps§! modifier, giving §G+1 attrition for enemies§! for 10 years."
ace_gjalund_and_the_giantslayers: "§YGjalund and the Giantslayers§!"
desc_ace_gjalund_and_the_giantslayers: "A tale that predates even the Dragon and the Skald. Long ago, when the Giants walked the earth, few dared to oppose them. Gjalund, however, took up his axe and slew many of the Giants himself, and inspired many to follow in his stead. However, Gjalund's story came to its end when the mighty Dragon started its horrid winter. With his most fearless warriors, Gjalund froze to death while camping in the skull of a dead giant.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain §G15§! army tradition."
ace_master_boat_builders_of_far_gerudia_beyond: "§YMaster Boat Builders§!"
desc_ace_master_boat_builders_of_far_gerudia_beyond: "Often recited by boatbuilders and sailors along the many coasts of Gerudia, the Master Boat Builders of Far Gerudia Beyond tells of an immense, ancient shipyard well past the frosted seas of Far Gerudia. This shipyard is said to be worked by small, pale figures dressed in warm furs, but the impressive part is the ships they produce. Huge longships with massive steel icebreakers are said to sail out of the shipyard, constructed of a wood never seen before.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain §G15§! navy tradition."
ace_tale_of_leif_snaketongue: "§YTale of Leiv Snaketongue§!"
desc_ace_tale_of_leif_snaketongue: "Leiv Snaketongue was an ordinary Gerudian, born in Redgarhavn many years ago. He was often overlooked, for he was not blessed with strength or courage in battle. What he was gifted in was the guile and convincing of his words. Leiv Snaketongue bought a vessel and recruited a crew, all in discount, of course, and set sail for the Alenic Frontier. There he encountered a strange city, named Celmaldor, inhabited by the Moon Elves, of all people. With the snake of his tongue, Leiv convinced the Elves to elect him as the leader of their republic.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YExploring the Limits§! modifier, giving §G-0.15 yearly corruption§! for 10 years."
ace_castan_ebonfrost: "§YThe Ebonfrost Epic§!"
desc_ace_castan_ebonfrost: "Some say that power is their birthright. That a crown is worn by those of a noble dynasty. That is nonsense: power is earned by those who seize it. The Castan Ebonfrost began his life as a lowly commoner in the backwaters of Urviksten, then a tributary of the waning Castanor. Gunnar Ebonfrost joined a reaver crew and made his living as through both tasks mundane and violent. The Ebonfrost grew in strength and glory over the years, contributing and leading raids and sacks across the Dameshead and Divenhal Sea. But his greatest adventure was the heist of Castanor itself: fooling them into accepting him as governor of Vrorenmarch, he tore his way through the soft Castanorians and crowned himself Castan."
ace_skcorin: "§YCorin's Sacrifice§!"
desc_ace_skcorin: "Like a tale of old, the young maid Corin slew the monstrous Korgus Dookanson. Although an Escanni, she has rightfully earned her glory, so much so that some proclaim her as a goddess. While her divinity is in doubt, her heroism is not. Both the heretics and traditionalists of the Regent Court have spun their own tales of gods and avatars: let us weave Corin's martyrdom into our own storybook to find common ground with them.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a Deus Vult CB on a random neighboring heathen country."
ace_elven_voyages: "§YElven Voyages§!"
desc_ace_elven_voyages: "Long have Gerudians sailed the seas for fame and fortune. From across the western seas the Elves have seduced and subjugated the Cannorians, and proved a vital blow against Black Castanor. Their voyages across the seas, tales of the long past, and political feuds have shaped the course of the past centuries. Pondered and scribed by the Skalds, accounts of Elven mythology and their feats are told throughout Gerudia.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain an §YElven Magnificence§! modifier, giving §G-10% idea cost§! for 10 years."
ace_ebonsteel: "§YEbonsteel Einherjar§!"
desc_ace_ebonsteel: "Behind every hero is their tool of trade. Axe and spear, shield and helm, horn and hammer - epic tales are forged through the craft of legendary smiths. From elden days, long before Elkaesal the White froze Gerudia, ancient Gerudians forged metal black as the night sky. Ebonsteel-clad warriors cleaved through lowly iron, shields withstood barrage, and mountains sculpted into statues in the Titan's Rest Mountains. The art of crafting Ebonsteel has all been lost, until now.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YBlack Steel, Daring Hearts§! modifier, giving §G-10% land maintenance and +5% infanty combat ability§! for our Ebonsteel Infantry regiments for 10 years."
ace_ambrstrond: "§YAnnals of Ambrströnd§!"
desc_ace_ambrstrond: "Discovering a new land across the western seas, Gerudians established the colony of Ambrströnd along the Hjora river. Called Dalaire by southerners, this land almost seemed like home: icy peaked mountains, vast expanses of pine forest, and winding fjords. But behind this welcoming facade were many strange dangers: hallucinogetic sap, wild magic permafrost, and the ever-watching Skraelings. The journals of the early colony were published back home in Gerudia, and proved popular as tales of swashbuckling adventure."
ace_olav: "§YThe First Gerudians§!"
desc_ace_olav: "Almost forgotten in myth, the tale of Urvik and Olav is old as the land itself. Leading their people north past the Jotuntars, Urvik founded the first Gerudian homestead in the Black Frost Mountains - Urviksten. Forging suits of armor and weapons of legend from ebonsteel, Urvik and his son Olav soon found themselves targets of the envious Trolls. Urvik's Rock was fiercely defended against the monstrous foe, and with ebonsteel blade and fire we drove the beasts all the way to the Dalr! Now a grown man himself, Olav succeeded his father and founded Olavsborg, and has been immortalized as the founding father of Olavlund.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YLessons of the First Gerudians§! modifier, giving §G+0.005% army professionalism§! for 10 years."
ace_gnomes: "§YFrom Thralls to Masters§!"
desc_ace_gnomes: "Harken to the tale of the small folk, the gnomes of the Dragon Coast! In the Age of Black Ice, they were brought to these lands as mere thralls, toiling beneath the gaze of their masters. But the wheel of fate turns, and so too did their fortunes. The sharp minds of the gnomes could not be ignored, and soon the jarls saw their worth. No longer mere servants, they rose to become majordomos and keepers of accounts, trusted in halls of power. This tale spreads hope among the young thralls and peons, for it shows that no man’s fate is carved in stone. Even the lowliest may rise, if their gifts find the right place and moment to shine.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YPlaces of Education§! modifier, giving §G+0.25 yearly innovativeness§! for 10 years."
ace_blue_reach: "§YMelt Church§!"
desc_ace_blue_reach: "Behold the Thednkerkja, the Melt Church, first raised in Coldmarket in the year 502. It is said to stand upon the very earth where the ice first surrendered its grip, when the dread Elkaesal fell into slumber. Thus, it is no wonder that Coldmarket holds the greatest number of Gerudians beyond their homeland, bound by frost and faith. This grand church stands as a living testament to the bond between our people and the hardy folk of Blue Reach, a symbol of shared blood and history, forged in the melting ice."
ace_anbenncost: "§YCity of Cities§!"
desc_ace_anbenncost: "Anbenncóst, the City of Unity, as the southerners call it, stands as the mightiest city in all the known world. No city of Gerudia — neither Bayvic nor Konungrhavn — can match its grandeur. Now, a new saga begins, written by our own hands. We are greater than Godrac the Invader, we surpass Ebonfrost achievements. We, the sons of Gerudia, shall forge a new age — the Age of Glory! Let the world remember our deeds, for we will carve our names into the stone of history, brighter and bolder than any before.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YHeart of Cannor§! modifier, giving §G+5% administrative efficiency§! for 10 years."
ace_harpies: "§YFrozen Feathers§!"
desc_ace_harpies: "Let it be known to everyone - Gerudia does not frown upon the strangers. Few centuries ago, a lonely flock of harpies sought refuge on the verges of Gerudian Frontier, escaping from the wrath of the southerners, but found only battle, beset by trollish raiders. With doom upon them, a Gerudian warband came to their aid, and together they drove back the trolls. In gratitude, the Harpies swore an oath to fight alongside the Gerudians, reclaiming the north from trolls and Elkaesal cultists. For the next few centuries, the harpies guided us in battle, outmaneuvering enemies and saving the wounded from a certain death, watching above from the skies. To this day, Járnklo Harpies watch over the warriors of Olavlund, rescuing heroes from the battlefield and carrying them to Vængheim, where their wounds are healed and their valor honored.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YHelp from Above§! modifier, giving §G-5% land attrition§! for 10 years."
ace_fall_of_drekiriki: "§YThe Fall of Drekiríki§!"
desc_ace_fall_of_drekiriki: "Drekiríki - The Realm of Dragons, also known as the Oddansbayer Kingdom, was a Reaver Kingdom on the Dragoncoast. Their capital in Oddansbay and the surrounding farmlands were hard-fought acquisitions resulting from fierce wars against tribal kobolds. Settled in 803 AA during the Era of Black Ice, the Reaver Kingdom operated as a loose confederacy of allied ship captains and warlords who aimed to settle the rest of the Dragon Coast. However, they were met by ceaseless resistance from the Kobolds who had won this area from the now diminished Gnomes. When Castan Ebonfrost's wars began few went to Drekiríki, resulting in the scale of power tipping in the other direct. The kingdom was reduced to a city state and for decades held the walls of what is now Oddansbay, until it was ultimately destroyed in 901 when Oddansbay was overrun by the Kobolds. The surviving Dreki moved to nearby Reveria, returned to Gerudia or turned to Reaving. Their tales of their desperate defense of Drekiríki, where every man, womand and child manned the walls, were never forgotten. \n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain a §YTales of Defense§! modifier, giving §G+25% Garrison Size§! for 10 years."
ace_expedition_of_hallfred: "§YHallfred's Expedition§!"
desc_ace_expedition_of_hallfred: "The Expedition led by Hallfred Henriksson Divenscourge is how the Hallfreders made it to Brendrótaland, the Dry Coast. Proving that all it takes to change history is a single restless Gerudian. After setting out with five ships from the old world, and together with four other captains managed to reach and settle Hallfredhavn, displaying bravery, wanderlust and a great aptitude in seafaring.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, we will gain §Y10 Naval Tradition§!."

desc_ace_burning_of_kykrskogr: "The Kykrskógr, also known as the Effelai or the Tswohvwoh'íi or simply the Living Jungle, is a living entity that at one point dominated all of the Effelai. Through the great sacrifices of the Oono'i the Dry Coast, Brendrótaland has been liberated from its grasp. This Tale reminds the Hallfreders, Gerudian Colonists and the Oono'i of that legendary war and of what one day may happen again if the entity reawakens.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, §YScorching Earth§! will refund the §YMilitary Power§! cost."

Through the great sacrifices of the Oono'i the Dry Coast, Brendrótaland has been liberated from its grasp. Renewed efforts to push the Kykrskógr back even further have been met with fierce resistance from Thralls, Skraeling, beasts and even the very vines of the jungle. The ancient lessons from the past combined with more contemporary experiences will guide our warriors to fight fiercely and utilise fire to the fullest extent.\n--------------------------------------\nWhen enacted, §YScorching Earth§! will refund the £mil£§YMilitary Power§! cost."

#Neratic Nerat nerat Kuradaz Kuradaznai 
kuradaznai: "Kuradaznai"
kuradaznai_religion_desc: "Kuradaznai, meaning 'Those of Kuradaz' are the followers of Kuradaz, the deity of ancient Milcorissia. In the Common Tongue he is called Nerat, and in Kheterata they have Nirakhet. He is the god of Death, Justice, Duty and Order. His Godwife Vaysora complements him, representing Chaos, Nature and Creation. Unlike other faiths worshipping Nerat, the Kuradaznai welcome death, and see undeath through necromancy as a way of eternal service to Kuradaz. Life is but a preparation for death and your service either in the afterlife in the shadow plane, or as an undead on Halann."
KURADAZNAI_CHURCH_ASPECTS_LONG: "Avatar Teachings"
KURADAZNAI_CHURCH_ASPECTS_SHORT: "Teachings"
ACE_LIFERS: "Old-Vaysorans"
kuradaznai_aspect_morgurax: "Morgurax the First"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_morgurax: "Morgurax the First, his name meaning Pious Justicar in Milcori, was the first to ever achieve Lichdom in 1620 BA, becoming the first Avatar of Kuradaz. He reigned from 1640 to 1158 BA and founded the Kuradaznai faith and the Kingdom of Milcorissia. He also laid the foundation for the ascension of all future Milcori Liches by passing down the information needed to complete the ritual in the Tablets of Morgurax."
kuradaznai_aspect_morakzom: "Morakzom the Unifier"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_morakzom: "After Morgurax made his journey from the unlife to the afterlife, a period of chaos befell Milcorissia. No Lich was there to take Morgurax's place. That interregnum saw the rise of countless necromancer warlords vying for land and the Tablets of Morgurax. This period saw massive loss of territory due to the vile Conqueror Bisan, who carved his realm out of Milcorissia. This period of strife was ended by Morakzom, who managed to acquire and study the Tablets of Morgurax for long enough to achieve Lichdom. He crushed the state of Bisan and unified the Milcori Necromancer Kings, ushering in a second golden age during his reign from 1035 to 894 BA."
kuradaznai_aspect_morvezta: "Morvezta the Luna-scourge"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_morvezta: "After the age of Morakzom came an interregum, in which many tried and failed to ascend to Lichdom and become an Avatar of Kuradaz. It was Morvezta who in 759 BA managed to achieve the highest form of unlife. His service to Kuradaz as King of Kings of Milcorissia saw the conquest of present day areas such as Galéinn, Middle Luna and the Menibór Loop. It is said that the Luna turned red with the blood of opposing tribesmen. His reign and unlife lasted until 539 BA."
kuradaznai_aspect_morlazar: "Morlazar the Diplomat"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_morlazar: "Morlazar's reign from 483 BA to 1 AA was troublesome, as he had to contend with the Castanorian Empire. The realm of Kuradaz experienced contraction due to Castanorian incursions and weakness from the infighting preceding his ascension. He managed to broker a truce with the Castanorians, earning his moniker, and securing the peace."
kuradaznai_aspect_xamarzu: "Xamarzu the Unnameable"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_xamarzu: "Xamarzu's reign was from 1 to 524 AA. He fulfilled his Kuradaz-bound duty by restoring order after the Day of Ashen Skies wreaked havoc on the world, and is attributed to have slain Morvezta, who fell out of favour with Kuradaz for unknown reasons. Xamarzu's origin is shrouded in secrecy, thus the moniker. He led Milcorissia through the troublesome period after the Ashen Skies, which saw numerous tribal migrations and the eventual fall of Milcorissia in 524. This event, known as the Xamarzian Damnation, saw Xamarzu making a defiant last stand in the Labyrinth of Varlosen, whilst the coward Rhinn ordered its entrance collapsed. All that is in the past however, as Xamarzu is back with a vengeance."
kuradaznai_aspect_canrec: "Canrec the Defiler"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_canrec: "Canrec the Defiler was not Milcorissian, but he was a Lich and thus an Avatar of Kuradaz, whether he knew it or not. He was one of Nichmer the Sorcerer-King's acolytes. Canrec was thought to have been slain during the Liberation of Castanor but he in-fact survived, and would later achieve holy Lichdom and cultivate the White Pestilence, a necromantic disease that nearly cleansed all of Cannor of unbelievers. He would later pass into the afterlife during the Aldresian Crusade, which was a response against the undead hordes of the White Pestilence. "
kuradaznai_aspect_rewan: "Rewan IV Síl Eilísin"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_rewan: "Rewan IV Síl Eilísin achieved Lichdom through the writings of Morgurax, and is the westernmost Lich of Cannor. He was the Duke of Eilísin between 1648-1666 AA. He was unrightfully stripped of his land and title for his interest in the Necromantic arts."
kuradaznai_aspect_dak: "Dak Chaingrasper"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_dak: "Clanboss Dak Chaingrasper lived his life as the leader of a tribe of Goblins in the Tree of Stone region of the East Serpentspine. He achieved Lichdom at some point, presumably entirely independent of Morgurax's writings. His Avatar status is doubted by some Human elitists, but Kuradaz has a plan for all."
kuradaznai_aspect_malazmur: "Malazmur the Magescour"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_malazmur: "Malazmur the Magescour, also called 'the Malformed' by heathens, is a black dragon and dracolich, and one of the two spawns of Zaamalot the Black. Hatched in Bal Mire alongside his brother Vazmaar, Malazmur proved far more reclusive than his brother, and sightings of the dragon have were exceptionally rare in the old times - most occurring in Malazmur's infamous assaults on mage towers and arcane archives, for which he has earned his title. The details and accounts of Malazmur and his life are scarce and sometimes contradictory - the dragon himself obviously left no biography. Together with the incident in Castonath in the reign of his brother Vazmaar, which confirmed much of the information gathered about him, the most comprehensive accounts of the dragon were compiled by the Magister Evin síl na Rhasthíl, who unsuccessfully hunted Malazmur in the 1300s and pieced together a rough outline of his life. All we know for sure is that Malazur achieved Lichdom, making him an Avatar of Kuradaz, even if he had to be reminded of that."
kuradaznai_aspect_kaino: "Shadow Lich Kaino"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_kaino: "The first Shadow Lich recorded in history. Originally a servant of a shadow swamp hag coven who tought him the secrets of necromancy. He Fought Aro the first emperor, but was defeated, a tribe who allied with the Kaino were renamed by Aro to share the name of the Lich and were exiled to the Dao Nako jungle. He has since attempted to secure a realm for his own numerous times. He has had fledgling states in the Shadow Swamp through the ages and has more recently been exerting his influence upon the Kaino People in the Dao Nako jungle. It is believed he once desired the extinction of all peoples to end the endless pain and suffering of life, but with his conversion to the Kuradaznai, he has regained hope."
kuradaznai_aspect_vaysora: "Godwife Vaysora"
desc_kuradaznai_aspect_vaysora: "Godwife Vaysora was once a rival deity of the ancient Milcorissians, but eventually grew into his Godwife. She complements him well, representing Chaos, Nature and Creation."
