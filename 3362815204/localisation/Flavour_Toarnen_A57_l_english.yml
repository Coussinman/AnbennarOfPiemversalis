 A57_muster_the_arrayers_desc:0 "The Array system is supposed to be conscription managed by the nobility, we must prepare the \"Arrayers\" to fight against a common enemy instead of being used by nobles squabbling over their petty fields or wineyards."
 A57_guard_the_folly_border_title:0 "Guard The Folly Border"
 A57_guard_the_folly_border_desc:0 "Our duchy is one of the least defended places in the Empire bordering both the Daravan's Folly and the Divenhal Sea: the raids are frequent, villages or hamlets are destroyed every month by gnolls, and worse, gnollish slavers from across the sea steal and abduct our pale-skinned citizens and see them as mere cattle to be sold to faraway lands like the days of ancient Milcorissia. By building castles in our hinterland and teach the peasants fighting skills, we will save some useful lives."
 A57_a_coast_of_roses_title:0 "A Coast of Roses"
 A57_a_coast_of_roses_desc:0 "Nathalaire, a city-state full of pirates and thieves, have always prevented us to trade with Bulwar: every time we tried to send traders, even to nearby Crathánor, we often hear reports that half the shipments were stolen at sea!

 A57_curtail_the_charters_desc:0 "Our country is now strong enough to remove the autonomy now given a hundred years ago, and the Charter of Celliande was only a short-term solution to appease the population anyway.

When the sun sets our army will be in full control of Bordercliff and Sorncell's inner settlements while being ready to crush any dissident."
 A57_divide_to_pacify_title:0 "Divide to Pacify"
 A57_divide_to_pacify_desc:0 "The revolts have been crushed and for the first time since hundreds of years, merchant princes nor little nobles can't defy our authority.

 A57_barbaric_alenics_title:0 "Barbaric Alenics"
 A57_barbaric_alenics_desc:0 "Wexonards arrived in their part of the empire in a slighty similar situation to ours, a migration founding a new home. But we are the blood of crusaders long-gone, and ours ancestor defended the would-be empire from undead abominations of the Aldresian Crusade! Wex? They fled their home after simply hearing news of dragons, and no doubt looted their way to The Borders.

 A57_a_forbidden_dialect_title:0 "A Forbidden Dialect"
 A57_a_forbidden_dialect_desc:0 "To teach them Roilsardi greatness, we first need to integrate some settlers in all the part of the Wexonard society. Then, we will fund Roilsardi professors to teach the administration and the nobility. After some years, most of those savages will need to speak Roilsardi to do any simple task in their lives. But it don't suffice, after they start speaking the Roilsardi dialect perfectly, we have to ban the Wexonard dialect on the pretense that it is incomprehensible to us - which I mean, isn't true, but it might as well be!"

 A57_spit_on_celliande_title:0 "Spit On Celliande"
 A57_spit_on_celliande_desc:0 "Look at Celliande, a rotten land full of scoundrels who seem to have forgotten their roots, and stick to this so-called "Arannese" identity! We should invite one of their diplomats, cover him with our infamous tar, throw him in feathers and release him blindfolded at the border. Now they'll know what we think of them!"
 A57_an_incident_in_sorncell_title:0 "An Incident in Sorncell"
 A57_an_incident_in_sorncell_desc:0 "Some of our spies in Celliande have a sweet idea: dressed as dockers, they will kill a foreign rich merchant by making a crate fall on him. We will give Toarnen Black Blood to other dockers beforehand so this incident starts a fight while our spies fade away."
 A57_celliande_will_pay_in_blood_title:0 "Celliande will Pay in Blood"

 A57_a_chart_for_sorncell_desc:0 "The population remaining in the smoky ruins of what used to be our eternal rival is obviously very hostile to us: let's reunite the remaining burghers and let them have some autonomy until we recover our forces, we can't let another uprising weaken our duchy."
 A57_pacify_celliande_title:0 "Pacify Celliande"
 A57_pacify_celliande_desc:0 "As for Sorncell, we must give to the villages some reasons to stay loyal to us. We allow they keep some kind of self-rule and an exemption to Arraying for some years."
 A57_renew_lilac_war_alliances_title:0 "Renew Lilac War Alliances"
 A57_renew_lilac_war_alliances_desc:0 "During the Lilac Wars we were surrounded by Celliande and Arannen who joined the Moon Party. But thanks to Sugamber's troops and to Busilar's navy, only the fringe part of our territories were occupied. We have a great debt towards those who protected us and even if the war finally ended, we need to keep our links with them now that we are strong enough so they don't see us as weak as a Lorentish teenager."
 A57_the_defender_of_the_east_title:0 "Eastern Bulwark"
 A57_the_defender_of_the_east_desc:0 "Arannen, Sugamber and Brinkmarches are considered as the shields of the eastern parts of the Empire against any invasion from Corvurians, elves, gnolls and worse. But if someone looks at the map of the Empire, its obvious most of the invaders coming from the east would invade by the flat lands and undefended of Toarnen and thus we deserve the right to the called the Eastern Bulwark of the Empire."

 A57_borrow_teinmas_title:0 "Borrow Téinmas"
 A57_borrow_teinmas_desc:0 "The Elfrealm of Ibevar isn't really a realm composed of only elves: in what they call Téinmas, Arannese humans are a majority. We can't allow this weak-minded Arannese culture to thrive in another country after all those efforts! But we like elves, their legends are as glorious as the Crusade and most of our nobility and Roilsard's is composed of "half-elves". Thus, we will just borrow Téinmas. The Elves strangely asked we borrow it for four hundred years and that we pay half of it now and half of it at the end of the deal, with inflation included: As the past seems to be more glorious than the future in Anbennar, we have no reason to refuse."

 A57_adelaide_parties_title:0 "Adélaïde's Parties"
 A57_adelaide_parties_desc:0 "Like every year since she has been on the throne, our Duchess, the generous Adélaïde síl na Loop, invites the nobles of the country to a splendid party. This year we will honor our glorious heritage: Roilsardi. Roilsardi wine, Roilsardi cuisine, Roilsardi costumes. All will delight guests while our poets will sing the story of our ancestors, the Roilsardi Crusaders who settled here during the Aldresian Crusade and saved Cannor from the undead plague known as the White Pestilence."
 A57_a_roilsardi_heir_title:0 "A Roilsardi Heir"
 A57_a_roilsardi_heir_desc:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is heirless and nobles start to quarrel about the which one of them will be chosen by her!

 A57_the_green_thorn_order_desc:0 "The Order of the Crusaders of the Green Thorn is an order made up of the bastards of the ruling family and of the majors noble families. We will officially integrate the crusaders into the army as officers in charge of training the recruits and as an elite guard."
 A57_roilsardi_immigration_title:0 "Roilsardi Immigration"
 A57_roilsardi_immigration_desc:0 "We may still be Arannese but we are very attached to far away Roilsard. As our relation with Saloren and the Roilsardi nobles in general is positive, and many Roilsardis under Lorentish rule desire independence, we will fund a huge enterprise: settle, smuggle them here and give them lands! Of course we expect Arannese farmers to not being happy about it but our duchy still have a lot of empty places in the woods to settle them."
 A57_roilsardis_first_title:0 "Roilsardi First"
 A57_roilsardis_first_desc:0 "The Arranese are a mixture of various cultures, including our homeland's, they are but corrupted versions of Roilsardis: Why would we accept to be the inferior version?

 A57_rekindle_our_culture_title:0 "Rekindle our Culture"
 A57_rekindle_our_culture_desc:0 "The more time passes, the clearer our origin and our future becomes. You do not have to be born on the shores of Roilsard to be Roilsardi, and after reading our cultural literature, we realize all the good values of our glorious ancestors: chivalrous, pious and dedicated to war. Anyone in Toarnen must follows this path must really be Roilsardi."
 A57_we_are_the_true_roilsardis_title:0 "We are the true Roilsardis"
 A57_we_are_the_true_roilsardis_desc:0 "After wearing Roilsardi clothes for many years and exemplifying their virtues, our people can't really be considered as the same than other Arannese. In fact, we are not Arannese. The conquests and subjugations of Roilsard by Lorent forever put a stain on today's Lencori Roilsardis who become soft-bellies and lackeys to a foreign power. If those in our ancestral homeland cannot bear the legacy of our people, then we shall be the ones to rise to the occasion!"
 A57_finish_arannen_title:0 "Finish Arannen"
 A57_finish_arannen_desc:0 "At the North of us only lives foolish and weak Arannese realms. Arannen, their namesake, and of Roilsardi like us, is the biggest offender as it is a old relic beaten hard to the Lilac Wars: To lead the Crusaders north again, will we must crush the decadent marquisate."
 A57_a_nameless_culture_title:0 "A Nameless Culture"
 A57_a_nameless_culture_desc:0 "Arannen is taken and with it the meaning of being Arannese. While most of the Aranneses have gone beyond being unified by Arannen, but we can still hear the others courts mocking us and portray us as fools. They will be punished by fire and steel."

 A57_defend_folly_borders_desc:0 "While other countries like Corvuria, Nathalaire or Arannen tried or are trying to colonize the Folly, we have no interest in those underdeveloped swamps.

 A57_northern_aranneses_title:0 "North of Arannen"
 A57_northern_aranneses_desc:0 "To the North lies the remaining small and weak Arannese states, severely weakened and preyed upon by their powerful neighbours Corvuria, Ibevar and Wex. If we are to show the Arannese the glory of Roilsardi ways and that we are the true protectors of this land, as our ancestors did in the Aldresian Crusade, we must bring them into the fold to protect them from these foreign powers."
 A57_northern_arrays_title:0 "Northern Arrays"
 A57_northern_arrays_desc:0 "The recruitment of new troops is becoming more and more necessary due to the growth of our duchy and the Roilsardi population gifted us many childrens who are not protected by treaties made for their parents. Each village of more than 500 inhabitants will have to give us 25 footmen for two years of military service. Most will be sent in Northern Arannese lands to pacify and organize the settlements of the region."
 A57_the_crusade_title:0 "The Crusade"
 A57_the_crusade_desc:0 "The gates of the Godshield are now open and with it the true face of the lands of Dostanor: In Arca Corvuria lies the secret of what happened during the Aldresian Crusade. The truth shocked many when it was discovered in a book by a soldier stationed at Asheniande: During the Aldresian Crusade, some Roilsardi crusaders accepted a blood pact with a unknown power which granted them supernatural powers and strength. Lucian síl Vivin, the legendary Roilsardi crusader who was given the title of Protector of Corvuria by Jaher, being one of them himself! We don't know if the rulers of today are as impure or if they have been corrupted but we must cleanse the land from the evil deeds of the ones who betrayed the crusaders."
 A57_a_pure_corvuria_title:0 "A Pure Corvuria"
 A57_a_pure_corvuria_desc:0 "Dostanor is in our hands! The Corvurian flag will be changed to a white crow bending under a thorny sun. But the main priority is to chase any anyone able to threaten our rule: may it be angry peasants or enraged soldiers, Dostanor must be a place of prosperity under Roilsardi guiding hands. Any mention of Lucian síl Vivin will be erased and any folk magic will be crushed so never a Roilsardi gets corrupted again."
 A57_margraves_of_toarnaiste_title:0 "Marquis of Toarnaiste"
 A57_margraves_of_toarnaiste_desc:0 "We are the Crusaders, we are their prideful heirs and now much more! Our mythical crusade and its heroes will be sung in courts for generations!

She always saw her lands as less green and less everything than Roilsard and thus sent many hidden letters to Saloren, one of the last standing Roilsardi states, about a future marriage with a noble of this far away paradise."
 A57_promote_the_toarnen_black_title:0 "Promote The Toarnen Black"
 A57_promote_the_toarnen_black_desc:0 "Emíl síl na Loop did much to import Roilsardi wine to Toarnen and develop the Toarnen Black Wine. Sadly, it's still a luxury product as taverns are filled with spirits or beer: we will promote it by making cheaper vintages while trying to keep an acceptable quality."
 A57_export_our_wine_title:0 "Export our Wine"
 A57_export_our_wine_desc:0 "Toarnen isn't and never was a trading hub and our geographical position does not make our duchy suitable for major trade. As our revenues are mainly from agriculture and the sell of tar to foreign ships coming in our ports, exporting some of our wine would open our country to the trade of luxury goods."
 A57_find_a_plaids_importer_title:0 "Find a Plaids Importer"
 A57_find_a_plaids_importer_desc:0 "The small pastures we have are providing to Toarnen a small but high quality wool, that is mainly used to make our famous black-and-white plaids we have become known for. Like our wine, it would be a nice addition to our revenues of we manage to establish business contacts and sell it beyond our borders."
 A57_black_and_white_fashion_title:0 "Black and White Fashion"
 A57_black_and_white_fashion_desc:0 "The Roilsardi immigrants are mostly farmers who had not much for themselves: here, they are seen as heroes and glorious workers who deserve a bright future! Seeing our beautiful plaids made poor Roilsardi immigrants envious and now they try to wear those colors even on ragged clothes, they truly are patriotic as we are. Those colors are also a symbol a refinement especially for those who play chess, but nobody really knows which came first between chess black-and-white colors and our plaids."
 A57_build_the_settlements_title:0 "Build the Settlements"
 A57_build_the_settlements_desc:0 "Clothes aren't everything to make a home. Thus, we pressured a five years-long tax on burghers to fund new houses to the Roilsardi immigrants. It will be small but sturdy log houses built on newly designed quarters, the wealthiest Roilsardis will be awarded sea-side houses of stone and wood so they can see the beautiful white cliffs around them."

Two hundred fifty six persons of any race, gender or skill can participate, so come fast to the address below to register!"
 A57_popularize_chess_variants_title:0 "Popularize Chess Variants"
 A57_popularize_chess_variants_desc:0 "Leslinpár inhabitants play a strategy game called the Cones of Leslinpár which is known for being too difficult to the population. Preventing the population to learn strategy and war is silly, that's why we will simplify the Cones of Leslinpár and make it playable on a chess board: each player will have sixteen same pieces on the board, and the goal is to eat all the ones of your opponent. As the rules are easy, it will be a good introduction to chess for the lower classes."
 A57_teach_chess_to_cannor_title:0 "Teach Chess to Cannor"
 A57_teach_chess_to_cannor_desc:0 "Chess can't stay a niche game only played in Toarnen and others few places in the Empire! It must be the most prestigious board game played at the court of the Emperor! We will write a book called \"Toarnese System\" who is about the basics of chess and with the help of Konwell's printers spread the book all over Cannor. Toarnen will be known worldwide as the birthplace of chess!"
 A57_the_great_chess_tournament_title:0 "Great Chess Tournament"
 A57_the_great_chess_tournament_desc:0 "Finally, chess is known wide enough that we may organize the Great Chess Tournament of the Empire of Anbennar, the first one ever done. Fifteen countries will participate, fifty rulers fighting not in the battlefield but in front of the same table. Of course, the Emperor will be invited and hosted with the greatest honors Toarnen can offer. Just one more rule will be added to the tournament to prevent any cheating: no magic allowed."

 A57_toarnese_grandmasters_title:0 "Toarnese Grandmasters"
 A57_toarnese_grandmasters_desc:0 "Having so many chess experts in our country, it would be silly not to take advantage of their strategic talents to rule Toarnen better. All advisors about cultural affairs must have won at least one chess tournament in Toarnen to be able to take office."
 A57_chess_and_war_title:0 "Chess and War"
 A57_chess_and_war_desc:0 "Some of our advisors are the best chess players among all Cannor, but how can a Toarnese ruler be proud of himself if he isn't drilled to deep thinking and too deep strategy? Each heir capable enough to learn chess will be trained by the greatest masters, in the hope to make him a great ruler both in peace and in war."

 toarnen_chess_training_mil_title:0 "Chess Focus: Military Tactics"
 toarnen_chess_training_mil_desc:0 "Pawns, like infantry, are mostly used to defend the core of the chessboard but they can also be used to pressure the enemy: the Thorn-Pawns Attack, the Harpy Attack and the Modern Bennoni are good teachings that a strong defense can become a powerful attack."
 toarnen_chess_training_dip_title:0 "Chess Focus: Diplomatic Cunning"

 #Events
 
flavor_toarnen.1.t: "The Whitecliffs Rebellion of 1356"
flavor_toarnen.1.d: "Nearly ninety years ago, commoners and some nobles led an uprising against Toarnen and called in the Lunar Party to help, almost costing us our independence. They were motivated by the fact that the Síl na Loop dynasty had raised too many taxes and levies in the coastal areas of the duchy over the decades, compared to the previous dynasty, a branch of the Síl Arannen, who were often beholden to the commoners. To appease their anger and prevent war, Duke Alann met with the citizens at Whitecliffs Harbour and conceded a bill that would give each town in our duchy consistent autonomy."
flavor_toarnen.1.a: "The Charter may weaken us, but our Duchy stands firm."

flavor_toarnen.2.t: "The Aiscestir Open"
flavor_toarnen.2.d: "People of all skill levels gather in Aiscestir, drawn by the game's recent popularity. Among them are some of the world's greatest, from Magnus of Gerudia to the young scholar Eílisabet to Casperion, an elf who has studied chess since the days of the Sorceror-King! In keeping with our standards, they are all dressed up for the chess competition, wearing beautiful black and white outfits, many of them in plaids made by our own craftsmen. You sit on a wooden throne in the shape of a chess piece, representing a king, and everyone waits for you to start the tournament. But instead of sitting bored on the throne, you sit down at a table and challenge a young boy (who you later realise is a gnome). The competitors soon realise that the tournament has only just begun and run to the chess tables."
flavor_toarnen.2.a: "May the best win!"

flavor_toarnen.3.t: "Defeated but Stronger"
flavor_toarnen.3.d: "Thanks to the education of our ruler, clever tactics and the fact that chess is a Toarnese pastime, we have made it to the semi-finals, but unfortunately your challenger, Magnus, has stopped the development of your pawn with a pawn of his, using a move called 'capturing a pawn in passing', collapsing the defences of your entire flank."
flavor_toarnen.3.a: "En passant! I shall remember that."

flavor_toarnen.4.t: "Accumulating Chess Praxis"
flavor_toarnen.4.d: "Our close links with Toarnen have led to an accumulation of chess knowledge, which has led us to a deeper understanding of chess theory."
flavor_toarnen.4.a: "I love chess!"

flavor_toarnen.5.t: "A Very Roilsardi Party"
flavor_toarnen.5.d: "On this night, the sound of wine being poured can be heard from afar as the casks seem to never end and the heads of almost all the nobles turn as red as the liquid in the glasses. Adélaïde dances frantically until the crowd is staring at her, and for a brief moment she becomes serious.\n\nThe young woman shouts to the giddy crowd, \"Death to Lorent!\" \"Our home is not lost, and if it is, we will rebuild it!\" as two guards unfurl two banners, one with the Toarnen flag and the other with the traditional emblem of Roilsard. To a mixture of applause and uncontrollable laughter, the Duchess declares that this party will be the last of her reign and that now, in order to make this dream a reality, the entire Duchy will have to prioritise a stronger society."
flavor_toarnen.5.a: "You heard that? Cheers! Another round to the Duchess and to Ruh... Roh... Roilsard!"

flavor_toarnen.6.t: "A Visit to Saloren"
flavor_toarnen.6.d: "The sea is as calm as the shores of Saloren. Adelaïde thought she would be greeted like a hero returning from war, but only a delegation is waiting at the port, and the small group quickly joins the palace. The Lord of Saloren proposes two nobles, both from good families who have nothing to lose by sending away one of their many heirs. One comes from a family of rich winegrowers recently ennobled, the other from a family of knights known for their desire for independence from Lorent. Adelaïde hesitates for half a day, but when the sun sets, she has made her choice."
flavor_toarnen.6.a: "Laurens, Roilsard is about culture and wine!"
flavor_toarnen.6.b: "Maurise, Roilsard is eternal!"
flavor_toarnen.6.c: "They aren't fit to marry me, let's parade in the city instead."

flavor_toarnen.7.d: "Recognising their unfortunate situation without foreign support, citizens from across the realm have agreed to meet and redraft some of the charter articles.

flavor_toarnen.8.d: "The despicable rogue Duchy of Celliande is gone.

flavor_toarnen.11.d: "The Corvurian revolt is no more. Peasant daring to muster the arms against his rightful overlords should be punished, and Dostanor is blooming with the sight of public executions. Some grandmasters were quite sceptical about the nature of the revolt, claiming it to be too organized, but the voice of dissenters were quickly dissolved in the overwhelming chorus of triumph following the complete subjugation of kingdom of Corvuria. A great victory of our people!"
flavor_toarnen.11.a: "Rejoice!"

flavor_toarnen.12.t: "Crown of Thorns"
flavor_toarnen.12.d: "A huge crowd was called and even more people came, most of them Roilsardi immigrants or their offsprings. A giant and free banquet was planned in New Toarnaire as today is the Coronation's day, where the Crown of Thorns, crafted by skilled elven smiths, will be shown to the population.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] arrive on the stage where the three flags of Roilsard, Toarnen and Corvuria fly high and open the casket, revealing a crown of an unusual shape: it is a crown only composed of thorns. Made in gold and silver, each wavy band of thorns is in a different metal. The thorns are only on the outside to not hurt the wearer and is very light despite the use of dense metals.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] put the shiny crown on his head, the flag-bearer reveal a flag with a red background, the crowns of Roilsard and Toarnen merged in the center, the Corvurian white crow to the right and the Crusader's emblem to the left. [Root.Monarch.GetName] then yells to your crowd: \"It is not the end to our glorious victories, Roilsard must be freed from impostors and kinglets! May Corin and our ancestors guide us across the seas!\""
