AC5_settle_the_caverns_title: "Settle Down"
AC5_settle_the_caverns_desc: "Since the fall of Nimrith we have been surrounded by danger on all sides - made to run with our tails in between our legs, forced far from our home and our kobold kin. Just like in the rest of the Spine, we are under constant threat by goblin infested caverns and bands of black orcs fueled by chants lauding Dookanson. The same black orcs whisper of a monster they call the Trickster which leaves villages destroyed in its wake. All of these things we run from. Despite the woes of the Spine we have survived here as scavengers and explorers. After our long journey we have found a reason to stay - the hot, bubbling magma within the Molten Core.\n\nWe will not last long here if we cannot increase our power, and with a now scared and battered people there is a window of opportunity. We will use a small portion of the treasury we’ve built and the knowledge we’ve gained while exploring to seize power from the local chieftains. The more stubborn amongst them may still dissent, but any increase in our control of the region is a good thing."

AC5_uniting_caverns_title: "Unite the Clans"
AC5_uniting_caverns_desc: "Through blood and sweat we have taken the caves of the Buradforge and transformed them into something more. Once a temporary safe haven of scattered tribes, we have become one people under the Buruzagi.\nAlthough we have already convinced many chieftains to join our cause many have been unmoved by our bribery and silver tongues. They resist our authority, desperately clinging to the power they have left. Infuriating!\nNow that we have absorbed all of the kobold tribes we must rein them in. Unlike last time we will demand compliance! We will use our growing authority to crush the dissenters, leaving them as nothing but a footnote in the history of our nation."

#Column 3

AC5_rock_smelteries_title: "Rock Smelteries"
AC5_rock_smelteries_desc: "We have begun to transform Buradforge into a thriving industrial center with support from Gor Burad. The ringing of picks against rock and hammers against iron sings out into the steamy hot air. All of it is fueled by the magma channels below.\nAs our molten rivers flow across more and more of the serpent spine, we yet again find ourselves low on magma. But we now have the industry; the forges, the canals, and workers all throughout. If we cannot retrieve enough lava from the Spine we will make more ourselves!\nThroughout our caves we begin constructing quarries which source great rock smelteries along the canals. The smelteries take in rocks from quarries, smash them and shovel the debris into large pools of lava. The then molten rock is released back into the channels for industrial use. Moltenbrand orcs are particularly in demand for this strenuous work. With their help, more lava than ever spills through our canals."

AC5_melting_walls_title: "Melt the Walls"
AC5_melting_walls_desc: "There was once a pale monster we knew as The Trickster. The orcs now tell us he named himself Orcrend as an insult against them, and that he belonged to a rare race of people called humans. Instead of living in caves humans live somewhere beyond, where there is bright light and no ceiling and the ground is green and soft like fur. This “surface” is where the orcs say Korgus took his men to fight.\n\nThese stories passed down from the orcs are strange to us, but orcs aren’t ones to joke about topics as serious as Orcrend and Korgus. If this place does exist, we should access it and see if we can exploit it. While the Firebrand orcs don’t remember the way out, maybe we can melt away enough rock to get there."

#Column 4

AC5_exploit_fissures_title: "Exploit Fissures"
AC5_exploit_fissures_desc: "Gor Burad had long sat intermittently occupied by bands of orcs before we settled it.\nDwarven holds such as these are confusing to us - how could anyone live within these walls? Not many would be willing to leave our caves to come here if not for a good reason.\nLuckily for us the hold is built directly above a volcanic chamber which makes the hold’s air hot and thick - great working conditions! We cannot rely on the lava in the molten core forever, so harnessing the magma in the hold is paramount.\nThe hold also contains a forge, centuries old and falling apart, yet fixable. It seems the dwarves funneled lava into the forge for metalwork and creating obsidian objects and art forms.\n\nIt will take quite a lot of digging to access the magma but afterwards we may be able to divert it for use in our caves."

AC5_funneled_lava_title: "Funneled Lava"
AC5_funneled_lava_desc: "After years of back breaking digging beneath Gor Burad the first kobold cracks through hot, red magma streams down Lavawater tunnel. Orcs and goblins celebrate alongside their Magmascale brethren as they happily take their pickaxes to less dangerous sites. The miners begin digging canals deep into the old dwarven roadway and through the rocky cave floor. The magma flows out and then through them, lighting our cave homes with a scarlet glow. We begin to forge our swords from the heat of the new lava, and roast our meats above it. If only we could coat our enemies in it…"

flavor_magmascale.8.t: "Declining morale"
flavor_magmascale.8.desc: "Despite months of hard work and our best efforts there is still no end in sight.\nIn the last months we have seen massive advancements in our abilities to harness magma from Gor-Burad, resulting in more efficient work.\nDespite the optimistic outlook, many of our workers are losing morale and are increasingly less willing to endure the terrible environment of the melted caves and the grueling and seemingly endless work."

flavor_magmascale.8.b: "Increase their pay and instruct them out to work more efficiently."

flavor_magmascale.9.t: "Worker mutiny"
flavor_magmascale.9.desc: "After another long period of work, the workers in the Lavawater tunnel have started once again to grow restless.\nThe kobolds, orcs and goblins have all started to complain that the project is fruitless and that the resources of the state are better allocated to building up the existing cave systems rather than foolishly find a way out.\nThese arguments are echoed by a growing movement that espouses that the Serpentspine is the home of the Kobolds and leaving it both unwise and sacrilegious.\nIf a solution is not found these disparate groups of people might topple our entire state.\nWe can choose to ignore it and just let workers leave and continuously replace them or we can try to keep the veteran workers by convincing them of the prospects of the outside world."
flavor_magmascale.9.a: "Our generals and leaders abhor such defeatism, ignore the rabble."
flavor_magmascale.9.b: "Invite worker leaders and involve them in the project."

flavor_magmascale.10.t: "A different light"
flavor_magmascale.10.desc: "Finally after years of continuous work, innovation, shed scales and some strife, the final layers or rock separate the cavern from the surface.\nJust as the lavamancers predicted the presence of a layer of sedimentary rock before one last layer of igneous rock or obsidian would signal that the surface is close.\nAfter realizing this fact, the workers reported to the upper echelon and the army has been sent to the excavated tunnel to be ready to move out of the exit and explore the surroundings.\nWary of the unknown, the generals have agreed that it's best to use the factor of surprise and prepare for the worse, lest the people of Orcrend or the hordes of Korgus are able to ambush them before a proper connection the surface is established.\nCuriously the workers found also found a small yet-orc sized cave system which leads to nowhere and yet seems to be very close to the surface and full of weird artifacts and painted and carved obsidian statues and walls.\nRegardless of the nature of this cave system, it's discovery speeds up the excavation process and after another week of work, a weird light blinds the eyes of the first kobold work to reach the surface.\nAfter enlarging the exit, thousands of kobolds and orcs would enter the surface."
flavor_magmascale.10.a: "A new era of the Magmascale has begun."

flavor_magmascale.11.t: "Fears and hopes"
flavor_magmascale.11.desc: "After a few hours of adjusting to the environment and painfully learning to not stare at the magma ball in the sky, the army took over and the workers were reluctantly sent back to avoid being detected and attacked.\nThe entrance to the surface was a relatively sparse mountain valley, yet that did not make the generals feel safe and they moved as inconspicuously as possible through the open terrain in small bands.\nTheir wariness was proven right when a band of flying goblins attacked one of the kobold bands, yet through their use of lavamancy they entrapped the weird flying creatures and brought them to the generals.\nWhile communication with such surface goblins proves slow, the kobolds luckily also encountered a small band of normal goblins that fled Korgus' horde generations ago.\nAfter convincing them to join the Magmascale, the army was able to acquire a lot of information about the surface, yet this information confused the kobolds, as no mention of Korgus or people such as Orcrend appeared in the accounts of the goblin.\nTheir accounts rather talked about humans, the race of Orcrend, elves, an offshoot of humans, and the so-called harpies, fighting over control of the hills and mountains.\nThe goblins speak of vast amounts of wealth and the prosperity of the human clans to the west and south of the hills, yet the officers were more concerned about securing control of the hills, still wary of the same threats they imagined the surface to pose, now compounded by the real threats of harpies and human-elven states.\nFor the prosperity of the Magmascale the surface must be secured!"
flavor_magmascale.11.a: "We will be ready for anything!"

flavor_magmascale.14.desc: "Zurzix skidded to a halt. The path ended here. He frantically looked around for somewhere to hide, but there were none. He could hear the rothe behind him bellowing. It was coming closer. The rothe slammed into the far wall as it turned the corner, but it shook itself off and looked around. Seeing Zurzix, it mooed and prepared to charge again. He braced his spear-\n\nSLAM\n\nIt took a few seconds for the rothe to realize that it no longer had a head.\nThe orc who had removed it from its body hefted his axe. He nodded to Zurzix. “Good thinking, using the corridors to your advantage. You’re still trying to imitate me, however. Don’t. You’re weaker than me- you can’t take a rothe head on your own. You have to know what your limitations are. You’re smaller, smarter, and faster than me- use those. Fight smarter than them, and if you absolutely must get into direct combat, fight better- you will be weaker, so you need to make up for it with skill.”\nZurzix sighed. “I know, but I want to show them that I am BETTER than them- that I am not a weakling. If I use tricks, they’ll just keep saying that we’re just little scaled sneaks!”\n“They can’t say that when your dagger is in their lungs. You can make them pay for mocking you. Let them mock your tricks and your tactics. You will be the one laughing when they die to your ‘tricks,’” The orc, Gork, replied.\nZurzix thought about this. “I suppose there’s more than one way to be strong."

flavor_magmascale.15.t: "The Cannorian Coalition"
flavor_magmascale.15.desc: "The Cannorians do not understand our noble vision and have joined forces to oppose us. They sing their cries of war and march against us. Vile scum!\nWe should flood the lands of the Cannorians to punish them for their assault on our home. But we need many more years worth of lava before we can transform the landscape into a more kobold friendly one.\nAs we prepare we will fight the Cannorians on home terrain if we have to. The humans struggle to face our heat which melts their flesh; the same heat which warms our homes and fuel our war machine. The paths of lava are not built for their weak frames and they will crumple easily if they try to take the fight to us.\nAnd so we shovel, and shovel, and shovel more rock into the lava generators. More and more begins to pour into out channels and we itch to open the floodgates onto Cannor. We will turn their blue skies grey with ash and cover their fields soot."
