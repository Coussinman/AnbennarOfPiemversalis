A30_lilac_wars_bombards_title: "Lilac Wars Bombards"
A30_lilac_wars_bombards_desc: "During the Lilac Wars, experimental bombards showcased their exceptional effectiveness as siege weapons, shattering the importance of fortifications. By securing these powerful but rare artillery pieces from the most skilled manufacturers in Cannor, we would be able to harness their advanced capabilities to gain a significant advantage in our own military campaigns."

A30_lothane_ambition_title: "Lothane's Ambition"
A30_lothane_ambition_desc: "Lothane III secured the position as Anbennarian Emperor by vanquishing the Silmuna pretender Adénn 'Skylance' during the 4th Lilac War. He now faces the task of determining the future of his Grand Duchy, surrounded by disgruntled enemies on all sides."

A30_seize_damerian_land_title: "Reign in Dameria"
A30_seize_damerian_land_desc: "After the end of the 4th Lilac Wars, many of the Damerian subjects have been put under our suzerainty. Yet our rule over the region is plagued by revolts and resistance by the local nobility that is strongly Silmunist. We will revoke most of the rights of the local nobility and put Wexonard nobles to govern the region, lest the Damerians rise up in revolt in the least opportune moment."

A30_estallen_tragedy_title: "Conspiracy in Estallen"
A30_estallen_tragedy_desc: "The síl Estallen dynasty is a close relative of the síl Wex dynasty through the late Queen Sybille síl Estallen. It would be unfortunate if, say, the avaricious neighbors from the síl Leslinpár's domains were to stage an incident resulting in the death of the síl Estallen king and heir. Such a scenario would, regrettably, leave me with no alternative but to intervene and assert control over the situation."

A30_pacifying_estallen_title: "Pacifying Low Esmar"
A30_pacifying_estallen_desc: "Lothane III remained the most legitimate successor of the síl Estallen dynasty after the Leslinpár's plot. As we expected, there were dissenters who dared to challenge this truth, serving the whims of foreign dynasties or shady cults. We must quash any potential further opposition by immediately centralizing control over Estallen, to ensure that lands of Estallen will be held by the crown of Wex for evermore."

A30_question_of_magisterium_title: "Rallying the Magisters"
A30_question_of_magisterium_desc: "One could argue that the beating heart of Anbennar is the Magisterium, an organization that unites and nominally controls the most powerful mages in Cannor. While most of the magisters may support the continued existence of the Empire of Anbennar, we have slowly infiltrated the organization with Wexonard magisters ready to support the resurgence of the Wexonard Grand Duchy. To solidify our influence, it would be wise to install the powerful Vinerick family as permanent Grand Magisters, ensuring that the Magisterium becomes a more solid ally rather than a §Rpotential obstacle§! in our quest for dominance over Anbennar."

A30_secure_magisterium_title: "Magisterium secured"
A30_secure_magisterium_desc: "Having taken control of the Magisterium militarily, it's time to flood the institution with more Wexonard mages and win the loyalty of the various neutral mages left in Damenath. The Magisterium will become an arm of the Wexonard state and with its support we will destroy Anbennar."

A30_solidify_lorent_title: "Lorentish Connections"
A30_solidify_lorent_desc: "The Kingdom of Lorent was a key player in the Rose Party. Despite their victory, most of the former Moon Party subjects remain de facto independent and even the vassals that respect Lorentainé's authority only do so conditionally and inconsistently. By assisting Lorent in their internal affairs, we would not only secure the kingdom's survival as an ally but also ensure they will stand with us for the §Rchallenges that lay ahead§!"

A30_partition_of_asheniande_title: "Síl Vivin Feud"
A30_partition_of_asheniande_desc: "We can't afford to leave the Duchy of Asheniande, an ardent supporter of the Moon Party, standing as a thorn in our side. If left unchecked they might once again ally with Arannen and Celliande, undermining our plans for the Borders region. Luckily, there are solutions to this problem."

A30_defang_orda_title: "Defang Orda Aldresia"
A30_defang_orda_desc: "The Orda Aldresia is an intriguing institution. Nominally meant to merely defending the emperor of Anbennar, it now serves the very emperor they spent 2 decades fighting. The deep-seated animosity of the Lilac Wars between us makes it clear that neither side holds any illusions about the other's intentions. Any pretense of mutual respect or cooperation is purely superficial. It’s time to bring an end to this farce once and for all."

A30_prepare_for_storm_title: "Reinforce the Crossing"
A30_prepare_for_storm_desc: "If the dream of true Wexonard Empire is to become a reality, securing the Damesear Crossing is essential to solidify our control over the heart of Anbennar. We will use our position as emperor to leverage our authority and compel the free cities to finance our defenses. By doing so, we can ensure both our dominance in the region and the strength of our core foundations for the §Revents to come after we lose the emperorship§!"

A30_wexonards_of_gisden_title: "Wexonards of Gisden"
A30_wexonards_of_gisden_desc: "The County of Gisden has deep ties to Wexonard heritage, having welcomed many Wexonard settlers after the devastation of the White Pestilence. During the recent Lilac Wars, the Gisdenese count betrayed his Arannese overlord by aligning with the Rose Party — a decision undoubtedly influenced by their Wexonard roots. It is only natural that we should now assist them in fully embracing Wexonard culture, strengthening their connection to our shared legacy and ensuring their loyalty in the future."

A30_troubles_in_sugamber_title: "Protectors of the South"
A30_troubles_in_sugamber_desc: "Our long-standing ally in the Rose Party, Duke Ewald II of Sugamber, has as heir only one legitimized bastard daughter, which presents a unique and advantageous opportunity for us.\nThe Síl Sugamber dynasty is a cadet branch of the defunct Ryonard dynasty, which lead the second Wexonard kingdom and whose members valiantly fought against the forces of Black Castanor.\nBy either proposing a marriage alliance or waiting for the death of Ewald II, we can restore our de jure suzerainty over Sugamber and continue the legacy of the Ryonards, either in blood or in spirit."

A30_punish_bisan_title: "Punish the Traitors"
A30_punish_bisan_desc: "The Duchy of Bisan was the sole Wexonard duchy to openly side with the Damerians of the Moon Party during the Lilac Wars, a choice that proved to be a significant and costly error. This act of defiance against our cause will not be forgotten and now the Duke of Bisan will face the repercussions of his betrayal.\nThe Neratic clergy in Corseton has been coerced by the Moon Party into denouncing us during the wars and has continued to lament the lack of care towards the fallen of the Lilac Wars, yet they are open welcome our rule if we were to financially support them and hear their pleas."

A30_restore_order_title: "Restore the Peace"
A30_restore_order_desc: "While the Duchy of Sugamber may now be under our control, it is clear that the local populace remains confused and perturbed in the aftermath of the pretender uprisings, which undermines our goal of permanently reunifying all Wexonards under one Grand Duchy. We will slowly win their loyalty and make it clear that they are Wexonards first!"

A30_united_grandduchy_title: "United Grand Duchy"
A30_united_grandduchy_desc: "Our first goal is complete. The Grand Duchy of Wex is now fully united under our rule, marking a new chapter of our long history. With our lands consolidated and our primacy firmly established, we can now look outwards and prove the world the true power and potential of the greatest member of all Alenic peoples. Wex must rule!"

A30_legacy_of_lothane_title: "Legacy of Lothane"
A30_legacy_of_lothane_desc: "Lothane síl Wex has achieved feats of legend in his lifetime, securing a place in history that will one day see him listed alongside other iconic figures such as Lorenan, Castan I and Jaher. His extraordinary accomplishments and visionary leadership have set a high standard, ensuring that future Wexonard kings will look up to his example as they continue to advance our dynasty’s ascendancy."

A30_first_king_title: "First King of Wex"
A30_first_king_desc: "The late Lothane has been referred in his lifetime merely as grand duke and often reluctantly as Emperor. With the end of the empire, it is evident to all that he de facto served as the first king of a reborn Wexonard Kingdom, regardless of the pretenses he kept during his lifetime.\nWe shall accordingly crown him posthumously as the first king and founder of the Fourth Kingdom and give him proper homage by building a crown embodying our banner's and royal palace's color."

A30_a_worthy_capital_title: "A Worthy Capital"
A30_a_worthy_capital_desc: "Wexkeep is a middling town compared to the Damerian and Esmari cities further West or North.\nThe rugged lands of the Wexhills produce little in the way of food, it is only because it has served as seat of many Wexonard monarchs and grand dukes that Wexkeep is a big as it is.\nTo truly match our growing prestige and political power, Wexkeep should be expanded to rival the regional capitals in the empire."

A30_impregnable_seat_title: "Impregnable Seat"
A30_impregnable_seat_desc: "The fortress of Bal Hyl was once a great and impregnable monument, which our ancestors only seized through ingeniousness and opportunism and which has led us to resist the forces of Nichmer and the Ebonfrost Castan for 3 decades.\nSince we first seized the castle, we have often lacked the resources to maintain all of the fortifications and tunnels, with many being rendered unusable by debris and large amounts of trash. With our newfound wealth we can finally restore it to its former glory so it can serve as the heart of Wex and an adequate symbol and tool of our power."

A30_unlikely_metropolis_title: "The Unlikely Metropolis"
A30_unlikely_metropolis_desc: "Our capital of Wexkeep has grown into a large city surrounded by many sizeable towns dotting the previously peripheral hills. Few could have thought that such rugged terrain could be molded to fit such a large amount of people and buildings, with Wexkeep being able to even surpass Anbenncóst. Every corner of the Wexonard hills sees bustling economic activity involving the trade and production of refined goods that the old Wexonard shepherds that roamed the land generations ago would have only dreamt to possess. No traveler moving inland through the East Dameshead will miss the opportunity to visit this magnificent city and bask in the prosperity of our nation."

A30_roads_divenhal_title: "Roads to the Divenhal"
A30_roads_divenhal_desc: "Trade in the Borders has always been a difficult endeavour, be it because land trade is rather inefficient compared to sea trade, but also because constant Hill Gnoll raiding as well as continuous period of turbulence, from the Xhaz of old, to the wars between Dameria and Castanor, to the wars between our Wexonard ancestors, the accursed Milcori and the dogs of Itrahures to finally the wretched hordes of the White Pestilence.\nBut hardship breeds spirit and the people of the Borders have long found ways to cope with the instability, we will help them by investing into the restoration and expansion of Escandar to our south.\nBy expanding the roads and settlements of Rhinmond and Vinerick, we will also help in making trade through the Borders a more profitable venture."

A30_land_of_drakes_title: "Land of Drakes"
A30_land_of_drakes_desc: "Verne has long been a thorn in our side, having fought fiercely against us in the Lilac Wars.\nNow with Dameria shattered and the Empire of Anbennar in ruins, the time has come to settle old scores. We shall turn our gaze toward Verne’s coasts, seizing their harbors and bringing them under our control. Capturing these vital ports will help project our power across the seas and control Divenhali trade."

A30_dethrone_istralore_title: "Dethrone Istralore"
A30_dethrone_istralore_desc: "Istralore, claiming for long to be the strongest supporters of the Silmuna and the Damerian Grand Duchy, clings to a legacy that no longer exists. With Dameria reduced to ruins and the Empire of Anbennar vanquished, little stands in our way. The time has come to dismantle this last bastion of Damerian lunacy and erase the final vestige of our ancient rivals."

A30_secure_damesear_title: "Center of Cannor"
A30_secure_damesear_desc: "The Damesear holds immense strategic and economic importance, not only as the former capital of the late Empire of Anbennar but also as the gateway to the Dameshead. Every ship that passes through its waters is subject to tolls, making it a vital hub for control over trade in the region. We have secured half of the island in the 4th Lilac War, but we must also secure full control of Anbenncóst and the Damish temples to fully take advantage of the island's position."

A30_expand_damestear_title: "Moonisle Mines"
A30_expand_damestear_desc: "The Moonisle holds vast Damestear resources. Given our reliance on magic, it is imperative to expand these mines and increase the output of Damestear which shall be controlled by the state, replacing the Magisterium's role in managing the flow of Damestear in the Dameshead."

A30_end_moonhaven_title: "End Moonhaven"
A30_end_moonhaven_desc: "Moonhaven, the main center of Damerian Elves and steadfast loyalists of the fallen Dameria. They once stood as close allies of Istralore, but with Istralore now destroyed, Moonhaven's time has run out. We will lay waste to their cherished tea farms, and in their place, we shall establish Wexonard breweries."

A30_along_luna_river_title: "Along the Luna River"
A30_along_luna_river_desc: "We must continue our conquest by marching down the rich Luna River, a vital center of manufacturing. The weak and fragmented principalities and cities that still dare to defy our rule stand no chance against our might. One by one, friend and foe alike shall kneel before us, their lands, people and resources brought under our dominion and used for higher purposes than petty local feuds."

A30_triumph_east_dameria_title: "Triumph in East Dameria"
A30_triumph_east_dameria_desc: "Our troops march in triumph from Damenath to Wexkeep, celebrating the final end of Dameria that our ancestors so long sought to achieve. Not only have we successfully subjugated the lands of Dameria, but we have also surpassed the glory of the fallen power and solidified our control over all of the East Dameshead, squashing any resistance to our rule. The fourth kingdom shall be the last kingdom of Wex, ruling over the lands of Cannor forever!"

A30_east_dameshead_global_eco_title: "Wexonard Dameshead"
A30_east_dameshead_global_eco_desc: "To secure our rule over the East Dameshead, we must win the goodwill of its people. By investing in the region's future, we will solidify our authority and foster loyalty. We shall fund expansive development projects, revitalizing and expanding the cities, transforming them into even larger centers of commerce and culture. Through these efforts, we will not only strengthen our grip on the region but also ensure that the people of the Luna river will forget their Damerian and Vernid allegiances and see our rule as a source of prosperity and growth, slowly coalescing into a new identity whose loyalty lies beyond defunct dynasties or kingdoms."

A30_wexonard_renaissance_dom_title: "Wexonard Renaissance"
A30_wexonard_renaissance_dom_desc: "With the growing prosperity and expansion of our realm, a wave of artistic and intellectual growth has followed. Wexonard artists, sculptors, and scholars have begun to produce masterpieces that are not only admired within our own lands but are now gaining recognition across the continent, sparking adoration and envy alike.\nIt is only natural that this influx of talent will be also found in our royal Grand Courts, helping with survival and continued prosperity of Wex."

A30_lothane_wizard_academy_dom_title: "Lothane's Mage Academy"
A30_lothane_wizard_academy_dom_desc: "Lothane was a great and powerful mage whose personal ambition, bravery and strength reshaped the trajectory of our nation. To honor his legacy we will establish a mage academy bearing his name. This academy will be a beacon of arcane knowledge and mastery, where generations of Wexonard mages will study and hone their craft. Stories of his talent and skills will continue to inspire our mages for centuries to come."

A30_expand_iron_mines_dom_title: "Expand Iron Mines"
A30_expand_iron_mines_dom_desc: "There is a saying that the Wexonard people are as strong as iron, and just as the people are strong as iron so are the hills doting our land abundantly rich in the ore, which has been a pillar of our recent martial strength and economic productivity. To fully harness this gift, we must expand our iron mines and encourage our burghers to invest more in the production and processing or iron ore."

A30_develop_blast_furnaces_dom_title: "Develop Blast Furnaces"
A30_develop_blast_furnaces_dom_desc: "The Vanbury engineers have presented us with grandiose plans of blast furnaces that will expand our production of steel as well as increase their quality.

A30_mine_coal_dom_desc: "High deposits of coal have been discovered in Ironhill, and the Vanbury engineers have presented us with a promising opportunity to exploit this valuable resource. With their expertise and new mining techniques, we can begin harvesting the coal more efficiently, unlocking its full potential to fuel our growing industries."

A30_expand_esmaria_title: "Expand in Esmaria"
A30_expand_esmaria_desc: "Esmaria, the land along the Esmar River, was not only one of the richest regions in the late Empire of Anbennar but also a crucial strategic position linking the Anbennarian hinterland to the Northern Damesheadic coastal markets. Our initial step will be to secure West Esmaria and establish a direct connection to the coast. Concurrently, we will seize the imperial archives, which hold valuable books and historical records."

A30_down_the_esmar_title: "Down the Esmar"
A30_down_the_esmar_desc: "We shall continue our advance by marching down the Esmar River, seizing the cities that lie along its banks. Where the Havoric kings of old failed we will succeed. The Gnomes, Dwarves and humans alike will soon learn to appreciate the firm Wexonard rule and abandon their petty squabbles."

A30_expand_the_glassworks_title: "Expand the Glassworks"
A30_expand_the_glassworks_desc: "Eastern Esmaria is renowned for its rich glass production, particularly in Giberd where one can find gnomes that have perfected the art of glass-making since the times of the Gnomish Hierarchy. To capitalize on this valuable industry, we shall invest in their workshops by funding these renowned craftsmen. We will bring their know-how to other glass-making centers under our control."

A30_esmari_papermills_title: "Esmari Paper Mills"
A30_esmari_papermills_desc: "Esmaria has been preeminent in the production of manuscripts and printed books, with Konwell at the top with its Imperial Archives. To ensure to the continued prosperity of the realm and the growth of Wexonard identity and literature, we will expand the existing paper mills and printing centers in Esmaria and hire Esmari book producers to help us establish new ones in the Wexonard lands."

A30_conquer_telgeir_desc: "In front of our armies lays North Esmaria, where the Havoral leans towards the northern Dameshead and forms a narrow gap controlled by the Duchy of Telgeir. We shall march and seize the cites of Esmarainé and the forges of Telgeir before finally crossing into the vast plains of Damescrown and Arbaran."

A30_integrate_vanbury_title: "Integrate Vanbury"
A30_integrate_vanbury_desc: "The Vanbury, shunned centuries ago by the Gawedi Great Lords, share with us a grudge against the Northern Eagle. By leveraging this shared hatred, we can sway their magnates and integrate their industries. We will assume control of their arms industry but also expand their workshops to settlements located near Wexonard mines to enhance our own military capabilities, ensuring that both our army and economy is prepared to face the Gawedi."

A30_professional_army_title: "Wexonard Troops"
A30_professional_army_desc: "Alongside our administrative reforms, our army must accordingly be more standardized and professional. Rigorous training will ensure that every soldier moves with intent and according to a shared goal. From the most barren mountainside to the coldest forest, every corner of the land will tremble at the sound of Wexonard troops marching in unison."

A30_conquer_damescrown_title: "Our First Refuge"
A30_conquer_damescrown_desc: "When our ancestors fled south during the Dragonwake, they sought refuge and safety, passing through Damescrown, only to be met with rejection and hostility. Shunned and then chased further south, they endured more hardship and struggle before seizing Bal Hyl and pushing back Godrac. Now the tides have turned. We return to Damescrown not as refugees, but as conquerors."

A30_conquer_arbaran_title: "Familiar Plains"
A30_conquer_arbaran_desc: "The Plains of Arbaran, once the homeland of the ancient Morbani, hold a deep significance in our history as the Morbani are among our ancestors, especially in Sugamber. These plains were abandoned when the Morbani fled alongside the Wexonards during the Dragonwake and the plains have been subject to Gawedization and then Anbennarian and Damerian influence... and yet the plains look just like in the stories many Wexonards tell their children and the people there still live lives not too dissimilar from the ones of our ancestors.\nIt's no mistake, this is also our home."

A30_rediscover_roots_title: "Rediscover our Roots"
A30_rediscover_roots_desc: "The old Wexonard homeland in the Alenic Expanse has now been rightfully reclaimed. This land, rich with the history and spirit of our ancestors, calls out to be restored to its lost glory.

A30_unite_the_borders_title: "Unite the Borders"
A30_unite_the_borders_desc: "To solidify our dominance and strengthen our position, we must first unite the region of Borders. By pushing our borders east up to the Folly, we will ensure that our core Wexonard territories are well-defended on that front. We will support settlements of the newly conquered lands with Wexonard settlers as some of the lands lay under-utilized because of emigration to Escann, Aelantir and because of Gnollish raids."

A30_overtures_to_milcorissia_title: "Overtures to Milcorissia"
A30_overtures_to_milcorissia_desc: "The people of the old kingdom of Milcorissia have always been devout followers of Nerat. To successfully integrate the peoples of these lands into our empire, it is in our best interest to support our shared religious practices and to make it clear that Wexonards are the rightful owners Milcorissia, by iron and by Nerat's patronage."

A30_daunt_the_lion_title: "Daunt the Lion"
A30_daunt_the_lion_desc: "Busilar has always been a rather unfortunate region, plagued by unending gnollish raids, Tefori and Bulwari domination.

A30_expand_settlements_borders_title: "Expand Settlements"
A30_expand_settlements_borders_desc: "With the consolidation of the Borders, many Wexonard settlers have established themselves in our newly acquired lands and expanded local agricultural production. We should invest in the expansion of existing cities and manufactories throughout the region, creating new markets for the increased agricultural production and by serving as cultural hubs for a new blend of Arannese-Wexonard customs."

A30_rediscover_our_brothers_title: "Rediscover our Brothers"
A30_rediscover_our_brothers_desc: "We and the Arannese people, though our current identities may differ, have shared this land for centuries, our histories and lineages intertwined since we first arrived in the Borders as we adopted Damerian and Milcori practices. Similarly, many among the Arannese people have adopted Wexonard practices, either through constant contact or directly from Wexonard ancestors that migrated east during the White Pestilence. We should leverage the shared bonds and slowly assimilate the Arannese people to our ways while absorbing their practices within our culture as we deem fit."

A30_godrac_treasure_title: "Godrac's Treasure"

A30_destroy_gaweton_title: "Destroy Gaweton"
A30_destroy_gaweton_desc: "Gaweton is the capital of the Kingdom of Gawed which has long considered itself the supreme ruler of all Alenic people.

A30_inherited_markets_title: "Inherited Markets"
A30_inherited_markets_desc: "The rich city of Damescrown alongside other Damesheadic cities lie in our hands.

A30_push_north_desc: "The Greatwoods of the Alenic Frontier lie just to the northeast, their vast and treacherous forests shrouded in mystery and dark secrets.

A30_riches_of_khenak_dom_desc: "The Mountains of Khenak are renowned for their abundant copper deposits, a rich resource not found in such densities anywhere else in Cannor.

A30_borders_no_longer_desc: "Once considered merely a frontier and an hinterland to a Damesheadic core, it has now become a vibrant and thriving core of an empire second to none.

A30_history_wex_people_desc: "The history of the Wexonard people is one marked by a cycle of failure, tragedy, resilience, ambition and triumph.\nFrom our humble beginnings as refugees fleeing the Gawedi to the re-establishment of the Wexonard Kingdom under Lothane, we have collected many stories passed both orally and through written accounts for a millennium.\nNow, as we stand at the zenith, we owe to our forefathers to immortalize our remarkable journey and their contribution to our survival. We will embark on the creation of a comprehensive chronicle of the Wexonards, capturing the essence of our sacrifices, growth and our final victory."

A30_synthesis_of_industries_dom_title: "Synthesis of Industries"
A30_synthesis_of_industries_dom_desc: "With the maturation of our economy and decades of experience in managing large-scale weapon and armor production, we can now combine the steel industries of the Wexonards, the knowledge on Damestear of the Magisterium and the Vanburies with the bronze industries of Businor and Verne to forge new cannons that can harness the power of magic and channel it to rain even more fire on our enemies."

A30_homeland_morbani_title: "Homeland of the Morbani"
A30_homeland_morbani_desc: "With the Arbarani lands under own control, we can slowly reintroduce the old Morbani customs back to their historic homelands. Through settlement of Wexonards hailing from Sugamber, which has been settled by Wexonards as well as Morbani, we will create a basis to reawaken the dormant identity. Marriage between Wexonard and Arbarani nobility will additionally tie them to our rule.\n Finally, sponsoring long-forgotten or minor surviving festivals of Morbani origin will lay the groundwork for the resurgence of a Morbani people."

A30_alenic_hegemon_desc: "Who would have thought that the Wexonards, once mere refugees fleeing the devastation of the Dragonwake, would ascend to become the dominant power in the Alenic Expanse? From those desperate beginnings, we have licked our wounds and have secured our places in the south and when the opportunity presented itself, we have conquered Dameria and expanded back north. Our influence now extends across most of the Alenic territories, matching and arguably surpassing the power that Godrac briefly held during the Dragonwake. Yet we will not fail where Godrac did and our empire will survive countless centuries.\nWex must rule.\nWex will rule forever!"

A30_our_claim_desc: "Lothane, in a strategic alliance, married a Siloriel princess, and now Siloriel blood flows through our monarchs. Though descent through the female line is often regarded as less important, in Lorent especially they are held as equal as patrilineal descent. We hold no pretenses to be fully legitimate pretenders, but a good excuse doesn't hurt our efforts."

A30_wesdam_foothold_desc: "The first target of our Lencori ambitions is Wesdam, the heart of West Dameshead and the stronghold of the traitorous Silmuna, which we held as dear allies during the 4th Lilac Wars. Despite their support their time has come to fully submit to us."

Silmuna loyalists continue to undermine him at every turn.\nThe weight of these constant challenges presses heavily upon him, and he begins to wonder if the way forward lies beyond the constraints of the Empire.

However, with the royal bloodline of Estallen extinguished, a new opportunity arises.

With a group of loyal soldiers by his side, he embarks on a journey to Orda Aldresia, determined to confront the rebellious order.\n\nUpon his arrival, Lothane wastes no time. He marches directly into the fortress of the order, his presence commanding the attention of all within.

But after a series of intense exchanges, Lothane's superior skill and magical prowess prevail. With a final, decisive strike, he cuts down the Grandmaster in the very heart of the fortress courtyard\n\nAs the Grandmaster falls, the knights of Orda Aldresia look on in shock, unable to believe that their leader has been slain before their eyes. The courtyard, once filled with the sound of battle, falls into a stunned silence, broken only by the cheers of the Wexonard soldiers who erupt in victory.\n\nLothane, unflinching and composed, wipes the blood from his blade. With a voice that carries authority and finality, he declares to all present that the ancient oath binding Orda Aldresia to serve and protect the Emperor is now revoked.

It would close this chapter without further desecration, leaving the memories of the fallen undisturbed.\n\nBut to ransack the crypt, to plunder its treasures and desecrate the tombs, would be a final, ruthless blow to the pride of Gawed.

In droves, they begin to migrate toward the once-great capital, eager to claim the abandoned ruins for themselves."
flavor_wex.40.a: "Let them have the scraps."

flavor_wex.41.t: "Goblins actively setting Gaweton"
flavor_wex.41.d: "The goblins quickly adapt to the remnants of Gaweton, transforming the crumbling buildings and streets into a bustling settlement. They establish markets in the ruins of the old marketplaces, repurpose grand halls as meeting places for their chieftains, and use the city's defensive walls as protection against potential threats. The ruins, once symbols of Gawed's greatness, are now filled with the sounds of goblin life—clamoring, trading, and the constant hum of activity."
flavor_wex.41.a: "What are they doing?"

flavor_wex.42.t: "Goblins become majority in what was Gaweton"
flavor_wex.42.d: "The goblins have proven their resourcefulness and ingenuity by transforming the ruins of Gaweton into a thriving city, entirely reshaped to suit their needs. With their keen sense for craftsmanship, they’ve begun producing unique ceramics, intricate and vibrant, unlike anything seen elsewhere in the empire. This newfound industry has brought the goblin city a measure of wealth and stability, further cementing their presence in the province.\n\nNow, emboldened by their success, the goblins demand recognition from the Wexonard Empire. They seek acknowledgment not only of their city but also of their place within the broader imperial framework. Their demand is simple but audacious: to be treated as legitimate subjects of the empire, with the rights and responsibilities that come with such status. They want assurances that their city, rebuilt from the ashes of Gaweton, will not be treated as a mere outpost or temporary settlement but as a permanent fixture within the empire."

flavor_wex.42.b: "We won't tolerate Goblins"

flavor_wex.43.t: "Kobolds show up in Gaweton"
flavor_wex.43.d: "Following the arrival of the Goblins, a small amount of Kobolds has trickled down from highlands west and north of the Westmoors and as settled in the ruins of Gaweton."
flavor_wex.43.a: "Surely this is fine?"

flavor_wex.46.t: "Start of mass coal mining"

flavor_wex.47.t: "Gisden in [This.GetName] adopts Wexonard culture"

flavor_wex.47.a: "Our heritage is being recovered"

flavor_wex.48.t: "Orcish Slave Trade Banned in Cannor"
flavor_wex.48.d: "In what started as a radical Corinite idea, the outlawing of orcish slavery in Cannor was eventually passed by a conglomeration of Anbennarian powers for instead a purely commercial and political reason: to curtail the influence of their western colonial rivals in Lencenor, and more importantly to halt rise of burgeoning great powers in Escann such as [Root.Country.GetName].\n\nWhile this did not abolish the act of orcish slavery but merely the trade, in the short-term it actually made orcish slaves rarer and thus more expensive for the benefit of many home-grown slavers of Aelantir to the chagrin of their Escanni counterparts."

flavor_wex.54.d: "Reports have been heard of Gnolls within imperial borders raiding Moon Party settlements, claiming to act under the authority of Lothane himself, as they claim he, despite being human, is worthy to be the next Xhazobain, pointing to the sacrificial pyres he created in Anbennóst and his magical martial strength. They have been captured in Sugamber and brought to us for judgement."

flavor_wex.54.b: "Our reputation can't be worsened by this incident, execute them."

flavor_wex.55.t: "The Bandit King of Stumpwood challenges Lothane"
flavor_wex.55.d: "During the Lilac wars our armies and efforts were concentrated on the Damerian and Arannese front. This focus left many regions in our Duchy lightly defended and guarded. Bandits have taken advantage of our moment of weakness to harass citizens and raid settlements for loot and protection money.\n\nAfter the end of the war we started squashing many of these bandit groups. Sadly one of them continues to evade our control in Stumpwood, where their so-called Bandit King uses very strong magic and the thick woods to avoid being found while peeling off the units we send to the region.\nGrowing bolder by his successes, the Bandit King has offered a duel against Lothane himself, claiming he will stop his activities and move to Arannen if Lothane won."
flavor_wex.55.a: "We accept the duel"
flavor_wex.55.b: "We cannot risk an ambush"

flavor_wex.56.t: "Lothane fights the Bandit King"
flavor_wex.56.d: "Having accepted the fight, Lothane handily won against the Bandit King. Despite his inevitable victory, Lothane was intrigued by the type and strength of the magic used by what should have been a mere Wexonard peasant with no elven blood. Thus he demanded the 'Bandit King' to reveal the source of his powers, but the bandit was hesitant to reveal his secrets, claiming that he could only reveal them to Lothane personally and to no one else, offering Lothane to go deeper in the woods just with the bandit king and leave the army behind."
flavor_wex.56.a: "What an insane offer! Execute this fool."
flavor_wex.56.b: "Lothane changes idea, the Bandit King will leave for Arannen"
flavor_wex.56.c: "Despite the shady offer and the risk, Lothane accepts"

flavor_wex.57.t: "The Bandit King proclaims victory!"
flavor_wex.57.d: "Lothane, busy as ever, has overlooked the Bandit King's challenge he formally accepted years prior. After years of silence the Bandit King has grown impatient and declared victory over the coward Lothane, intensifying his activity in the province of Stumpwood, weakening our control over the province even more."
flavor_wex.57.a: "We have far more important matters to focus on."

flavor_wex.58.t: "The Wexonard Bandit King has moved to Marllin"
flavor_wex.58.d: "Wexonards, ever skilled at being violent beasts only barely above Gnolls, have seen an increase in banditry near our borders during the war.\nUntil now we laughed at the misfortunes our neighbors faced after the end of the war, but unexpectedly the so-called Bandit King controlling the largest bandit organization in the Borders has moved to Marllin near our capital and has started to raid and harass our caravans and travelers.\nWe suspect Lothane has paid him to move to our lands."
flavor_wex.58.a: "The Wexonards show themselves as a wretched people once again"

flavor_wex.100.d: "The death of Lothane marks a drastic shift in Anbennarian inner politics, as the strength of our armies and prestige of our state have depended on the magical talent of the late Lothane as well as his position as emperor.\nDuring his rule we have used Anbennarian institutions as well as threat of invasion to force Anbennarian princes to do our bidding.

They have offered us closer cooperation and support for our growing realm in exchange for autonomy. What should be done with them?"

flavor_wex.201.d: "Before the Damerian Republic, Wesdam was a firmly Lencori region. With the advent of the republic and later through the growth of the Damerian kingdom, the region has experienced a decline of its former Lencori Carneteri culture. Now with the reconsolidation of the Lorentish kingdom under the Dual Monarchy and the construction of the massive Rose Road, the lands of Wesdam have seen continuous migration, tourism and trade with the Lorentish land further West.\nThe nobility of Wesdam already connoisseur of Lorentish culture have now started fully embracing the Lorentish identity. The death of the Grand Duchy of Dameria will inevitably lead to the death of West Damerians as an identity."
flavor_wex.201.a: "Neat"

flavor_wex.202.t: "Lorentish Hinterland embraces High Lorentish culture!"
flavor_wex.202.d: "Since the formation of the High Kingdom of Lencenor, Lorenti culture has dominated the vast plains from Mistspear to Oldport. Despite the continuous existence of this shared culture to the present day, over the centuries through the fragmentation of Lorenan's kingdom the rustic culture of the western plains have slowly drifted apart from the refined culture of the Bloodwine.\nWith the political reunification of Lorent and the vanquishing of the Winelords and other petty duchies, the only center of power left in the region is Lorentainé.\nWith the Dual Monarchy heavily promoting High Lorentish culture the people of the plains have slowly come to see themselves as truly the same people as the Winelords on the Bloodwine or the city dwellers and merchants in Oldport and Lorentainé, the reunification of Lorent is happening in the minds and hearts of countless proud western Lorentish people."

flavor_wex.204.d: "After more than 2 decades of activity, the resources of the anti-Wexonard Lorentish faction dwindle and their fighting will has died down, with the more pliant side becoming more dominant in Lorentish internal affairs.\nWhile we will likely face more rebellions, their strength will go down with time, soon our dream of uniting the 2 Crowns will be achieved!"

Akasik has served our countrymen well in their landings in Sarhal and so we shall take it upon ourselves to liberate these long-suffering folk… of their riches and resources. While there, we shall establish a new crown and kingdom to instill in their people a new purpose: serving their Wexonard overlords and guarding our seas."
ibevari_march_lorent_title: "Establish an Elven Protectorate"
ibevari_march_lorent_desc: "The crowns of our realm have been deadlocked in debate about the future of our borderlands with Escann. The Wexonards, distrustful of elves, see no reason to allow even a measure of autonomy to the realm. The Lorentish use a more pragmatic argument to sway the Wexonards: a state governed by those with lifespans of hundreds of years, purely devoted to the defense of our borders from orcs and other eastern threats. The verdict is clear with even the Wexonards swayed. The crowns shall establish an elfrealm of our own."
dragon_coast_march_title: "Establish a Dragon Coast Protectorate"
dragon_coast_march_desc: "Tense debates were held following the conquest of the Dragon Coast. The Lorentish elite sought to divide it into an extension of their existing feudal realm. The Wexonards; opposed to the balance of power shifting drastically towards the Lorentish, and feigning sympathy to the plight of the gnomes offered a new solution. A technocratic margravate, charged with furthering the scientific development of the two crowns. The Lorentish, left unable to counter this proposition, have no choice but to make way for a new crown in the realm; albeit one tiny enough to fit a gnome."
alenic_reach_march_title: "Establish an Alenic Reach Kingdom"
alenic_reach_march_desc: "The rise of Gawed has lead to the dispersal of smaller Alenic tribes, of course with us Wexonards being the most prevalent among them. With the defeat of Gawed, we are now the leading Alenic power and we must reach out to our northern cousins in the Reach that have resisted Gawedi incursion for a millennium. The time for division is over. We shall extend a hand to them; creating a new realm for them to live in peace; and to teach them our ways once more."
west_dameshead_march_title: "Establish a West Dameshead Duchy"
west_dameshead_march_desc: "While the vital need of a friendly state between us and our Lorentish contemporaries has always been known, the effeminate Damerians have proven themselves incapable of even that. It is clear that Wexonard rule is needed to shape these Damerians into a proper fighting force. So it shall be that we establish a new realm, bound in blood to ours and governed with an iron fist to forever secure our rule and crush any remaining hope for a free Dameria."

increase_wine_price_decision_desc: "Our state finances are struggling, taxing wine will help make up for the shortfall."

A30_lords_of_the_wexkeep: "Lords of the Wexkeep"
A30_lords_of_the_wexkeep_desc: "Almost a thousand years ago, the dragons of Cannor awoke from their slumber, and brought down wrath and ruin upon the lands of men. The Gawedi tribes, hearing of the destruction wrought upon Khugdihr and Castonath, took flight - displacing those who would become known as the Three Tribes: the Marrodics, the Morbani, and the Wexonards.\n\nFearing enslavement at the hands of the Gawedi, or destruction at the claws of the dragons, we Wexonards fled south into the Damerian Republic, until we found the great citadel the Damerians called ‘Bal Hyl’. Yet the Gawedi learned of the fortress and desired it as a prize, and soon we were trapped; caught between the walls and the hordes of the north, and there beneath the gaze of Bal Hyl we fought and died for our continued existence. \n\nWhen the castellan demanded our vassalage afterwards, at first we agreed to his terms, stalling for time. But when Damenath burned, the Republic collapsed, and the garrison were isolated, our braves surged through the old tunnels that the castellan and his men had forgotten. That day, Bal Hyl fell. In its place rose the Wexkeep."
A30_wex_must_rule: "Wex Must Rule"
A30_wex_must_rule_desc: "“Wex must rule - and I shall make it so.” - Lothane III síl Wex, Emperor of Anbennar and Grand Duke of Wex.\n\nThe fall of Dameria and the end of the House of Silmuna following the Fourth Lilac War has shattered the fragile state of Anbennarian politics, and for the Empire to survive in this new age, it must be brought to heel - by force if necessary. The unruly imperial estates,long a thorn in the side of the Dove Throne, can no longer be permitted to delay or obstruct the centralization of the empire at the hands of the Emperor. The electoral lackeys of the pathetic ‘Moon Party’ must be divested of their power, and those sympathetic to our wishes for a strong, united Empire elevated in their place. The legacy of Lothane III must be that of the first step towards the unification of Anbennar - the realization of true Cannorian unity. \n\nWex must rule. We must make it so."
A30_wexonard_school_of_fencing: "The Art of Fighting"
A30_wexonard_school_of_fencing_desc: "The peoples of the Alen are almost universally renowned for the prowess of their infantry. The sons of Godrac the Tyrant present seas of spear-points toward their enemies, the Reachmen barrage their foes with crossbows from behind their pavise shields, and we Wexonards boast some of the bravest and most fearsome soldiers in the Empire of Anbennar: the Wexonard Greatswords.\n\nThe Greatswords are trained according to the tenets of the Wexonard School of Fencing as laid down in the book “The Art of Fighting”, which prioritizes two things above all: speed and aggression on the offense, and breaking through static defense. Clad in heavy three-quarter plate, and experts at both breaking pike formations and hacking down charging knights with their mighty two-handed swords, the Greatswords follow in the footsteps of the ancient Wexonard braves. They are often called upon to form the ‘forlorn hope’ - a title given to those who are tasked with the most dangerous of roles, such as the first into a breach, or the rearguard when on the retreat. Only the best and bravest are suitable for employment in the Greatswords."
A30_court_of_the_grand_duke: "The Court of the Grand Duke"
A30_court_of_the_grand_duke_desc: "“Therefore it must be concluded that wise counsels, from whoever they come, must necessarily be due to the prudence of the prince, and not the prudence of the prince to the good counsels received.” - Jon Bardswood, Wexonard philosopher and author.\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Wex is the last Grand Duchy of Anbennar, following the shattering of both of our rivals, Dameria and Esmaria, with the end of the Fourth Lilac War. As such, the prestige and honour that the position of Grand Duke used to command has been tarnished somewhat, even with the accession of Lothane III to the Dove Throne. This must be rectified, and there is no finer way to prove the prestige and grandeur of our court and our culture to the Empire than to have only the wisest and most learned Wexonard men and women advising the Grand Duke."
A30_forges_of_the_iron_hill: "The Forges of the Iron Hill"
A30_forges_of_the_iron_hill_desc: "The Wexhills, our homeland, are a veritable treasure trove of mineral resources simply begging to be exploited. The richest of all - our prize possession - is the Ironhill, to the north of the Wexkeep, and the seemingly-endless stream of iron ore pouring forth from her punctured flanks over the centuries.\n\nThe bloomeries of old have been replaced by rows of blast furnaces, fuelled by the coal produced alongside the iron ore, and our production has only increased over the years as more uses for iron and steel have been found, both at peace and at war. Be they mighty cannons and their ammunition, or ever-stronger plate for the Greatswords, our miners continue to plumb the depths of the Ironhill in search of ever more metal, so that our armies shall never lack for good Wexonard steel."
A30_the_burgeoning_burghers_of_wex: "The Burgeoning Burghers of Wex"
A30_the_burgeoning_burghers_of_wex_desc: "The Grand Duchy of Wex - and the Borders as a whole - are in general less urbanized than other regions such as old Dameria or Esmaria, but their lands are no less well-traveled by merchants criss-crossing the Empire. Whether they sail down the River Cotumer down to Verne, trundle along the Salt Road towards Arannen, or traverse Wex’s new lands in the Damerian Dales, merchants rely on Wexonard protection whilst transiting all through the Borders.\n\nWith the reclamation of the Folly and the Khenak Range well underway, trade into and out of the Empire is also on the increase. Old urban centres such as Magdalaire and Tellum are increasingly supplanted by newer towns such as Indlebury, Vinerick, or Rhinmond, and new merchant families from these new towns are challenging the old guard. All of this commerce is carried out under the watchful eyes of the Grand Duke of Wex - and their tax collectors, for the Duke naturally demands a cut from each transaction."
A30_iron_within_iron_without: "Iron Within, Iron Without"
A30_iron_within_iron_without_desc: "Such is the motto of House Robacard, lords of the Ironhill, and Grand Dukes of Wex following the accession of Camir Silmuna.\n\nWexonards have always proven a hardy and rugged people since the days of the Three Tribes, and they are well-suited to the rigors and strenuous nature of warfare, even as the thunder of cannon fire and peal of musketry replaces the clash of steel on steel. Our soldiers are renowned as particularly stoic, grim, and dour folk, who bear the harshest of burdens with little complaint, and hold their lines behind the Eminent Banner even in the face of the most withering fusillades.\n\nAs warfare has become ever more focused on the exchange of gunfire, it has become more common to see Wexonard infantrymen constructing temporary fieldworks such as shallow trenches or earthworks to better absorb incoming fire. This, as well as the retention of Ironhill-forged helms and cuirasses by line infantrymen, has given Wexonard armies a reputation for positively dwarven hardiness in the face of the enemy."

The unruly imperial estates, long a thorn in the side of the Dove Throne, will be coopted and used to fulfill our objectives. The electoral lackeys of the pathetic ‘Moon Party’ must be destroyed on the battlefield, and those that share in our objective of a a strong, united Wexonard kingdom elevated in their place.
