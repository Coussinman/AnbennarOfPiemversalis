string_start_reveria: "§g\"The Lorentish don't fear breaching the Portroy Agreement, but they do fear being breached by our axes!\"\n-Famous part of King Lothane III's inauguration speech§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nReveria is a kingdom formed during the §YEra of Black Ice§! (768 - 978 A.A.) by Reavers from Gerudia who raided and ultimately settled these and many other lands. The kingdom itself, along with its ancient dynasty and capital, owes its name to this ancestry.\nAlthough names have shifted due to the adoption of the Common tongue, the síl Rever dynasty has held these lands since the founder of the dynasty Askel the Reaverking conquered it in 825 A.A.\n\nReveria is famous for its fearsome warriors and distinct culture, which is a unique mix between §YGerudian§! and §YLencori§! traditions and customs. No other Reaver state has held onto its Gerudian traditions as well as Reveria; To the north §YDrekiríki§! fell to the Kobolds, and our southward cousins in §YDeranne§! & §YPearlsedge§! don't even wear fur anymore! The state has legally secured its southern border by forcing the §YLorentish§! to sign the §YPortroy Agreement§! in their moment of weakness during the Era of Black Ice, ensuring the land this side of the Portroy river is de jure Reverian. The old and infertile Reverian King Lothane III síl Rever has long stopped valuing pieces of paper however, and has recently started investing in steel instead. Reveria has both halfling and gnome minorities in its current domain but used to rule over a vastly greater amount of Gnomes back before the §YGnomish Pass§! was lost to our greatest rival §RNimscodd§!, a rump state of Gnomes that seeks to unite all gnomekind under one banner.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe northern border is a volatile one. For hundreds of years the Reverians have had tense relations with the kobolds, scaled monsters that overran Reveria's closest ally and Reaver brother-state Drekiríki when untold numbers of kobolds emerged from the caves of the Dragon Coast. Although Reveria has ruled over the Gnomish Pass for centuries, it has been violently wrested from their control by the §YCliff Gnomes§! of §RNimscodd§! in 1396, when they had the support of the §YGawedis§!. Reconquering the Gnomish Pass has been on the mind of every Reverian general, noble and patriot ever since.\n\nIf Reveria is to survive the ages, it will have to either carefully maintain the balance between itself and the two giants of §YLorent§! and §YGawed§! or uproot that balance entirely, coming out on top. Who Reveria ends up allying themselves to is perhaps the greatest decision one can make: will they seek allies in the south, where they have supported the §YLorentish§! in the §YLilac Wars§! not a year prior, using a thankful §YLorent§! to cement an alliance? Or will Reveria align itself with §YGawed§!, who they have fought against as recently as 1396 but is the only viable option to defend oneself against §YLorent§!?\n\nReveria is approaching a tumultuous time with no heir to the throne, an old king, a war against the Gnomes on the horizon and nothing but the sharpest axes south of the Bay of Chills and a flimsy piece of paper to hold §YGawed§! and §YLorent§! at bay."

boost_militarization_desc: "Militarization played a crucial role in the development of Prussia during the 17th and 18th centuries. Under the rule of King Frederick William I, Prussia became a highly centralized state with a strong military focus. The king saw the military as the cornerstone of the state, and invested heavily in the training, organization, and equipment of the Prussian army. This emphasis on militarization helped Prussia become one of the strongest powers in Europe and allowed it to successfully defend itself against its enemies and expand its territories. The Prussian army became a model for other European powers, and its tactics and organizational structure were widely imitated. As a result, militarization was a key factor in the rise of Prussia as a great power during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n "
