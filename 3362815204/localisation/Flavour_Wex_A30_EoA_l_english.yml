A30_claims_rubenaire_desc: "Acromton is ruled by a branch of the Rubenaire dynasty, the same dynasty that rules over Rubenaire, Tretun and Laséan currently. We can help the Acromton branch to take over the Rubenaire Duchy, making it so the duchy becomes a vassal under Wex."

A30_sway_winelords_desc: "The Winelords of Lencenor are an influential group of nobles and merchants that partitioned the Winebay among themselves during the decline of Lorent's central monarchy during the Lilac Wars. With Lorent quickly resurging and expanding its influence over the region, we should sway the Winelords to our side and offer them protection and autonomy in exchange for their entry into the Empire."

A30_anbennarian_winebay_title: "Anbennarian Winebay"
A30_anbennarian_winebay_desc: "By bringing Winebay under imperial control we gain a dominance over Lorent. By controlling the main trade artery of Lencenor the monarchy of Lorent will soon grow weak enough to destroy in one war."

A30_dismantle_lorent_title: "Dismantle Lorent"
A30_dismantle_lorent_desc: "Lorent have been our allies during the Lilac Wars, but ultimately their ambitions to expand into the empire clashed with our ambitions of leading a strong Anbennar. They may begrudge our 'betrayal', but their kingdom's days are number as we will soon march on Lorentainé and seize it as our direct fiefdom, for we have a claim to it by virtue of our past royal marriage with the Siloriel dynasty."

A30_dove_above_roses_title: "Dove above Roses"
A30_dove_above_roses_desc: "To prove the supremacy of the Dove over the Lorentish Rose, every corner of Lencenor must be brought under Imperial control, whether through soft words or cold steel. There can be only one overarching ruler in Lencenor, and that is the Emperor of Anbennar."

A30_magisterial_connections_desc: "Since the start of the 4th Lilac war, the Magisterium has been not-so-secretly dominated by Wexonard magisters, chief among them Crovan of Vinerick. We should use this to our advantage and strengthen our ties and influence in the institution diplomatically."

A30_reform_orda_aldresia_title: "Reform the knights"
A30_reform_orda_aldresia_desc: "The Aldresian Order has been left a mere husk of its former self, with decades of warfare reducing the amount of new recruits and their units decimated in battle or deserting to reclaim Escann.

A30_road_to_dameria_desc: "Our Damerian vassals fell into our hands during the final Lilac War.

We will work to improve our standing with the Damerians and Estallen. Additionally we will build a road that connects their Wexkeep to Damenath, which will benefit our Damerian vassals greatly. This will be the first of many steps of our diplomatic 'conquest' of Dameria."

A30_plumwall_farmlands_title: "Farmlands of Plumwall"
A30_plumwall_farmlands_desc: "Farmlands of Plumwall are fertile and known for their plums, yet they have been especially devastated by the Lilac Wars.

Despite our valid excuses, we can only make amends by helping rebuilding the city using our funds. While the elves, gnomes and dwarves might remember the siege and sack for generations to come, we will at least win the respect of the shorter lived races in the city."

A30_building_the_dove_road_desc: "To strengthen our legitimacy and to make sure our legacy as emperors is remembered, we will expand the road system we already build and connect all the lands of the empire.

A30_restore_west_dameshead_desc: "The lands of west Dameshead have been left in a limbo after the 4th Lilac War, with Lorent holding what is nominally imperial land in Ordoin and the rump Duchy of Saloren being left in an unclear diplomatic position after they tried to join the Empire at the start of the 4th Lilac War and then losing to Lorent. This diplomatic chaos can be used as an opportunity to push back the Lorentish and gain the respect of the West Damesheadic princes. We will befriend the counties in the Carnetori forests as well as the Roilsardi princes still standing and offer them land in exchange for diplomatic support within the empire and against Lorent."

A30_integrate_roilsard_title: "Integrate Roilsard"
A30_integrate_roilsard_desc: "The Roilsardi area is now under firm imperial control, yet there is more work to be done. We will expand the Dove Road in the region, deepen our ties with Roilsardi magnates by increasing our mercantile activity in the Winebay and by extensive diplomatic and cultural exchanges.

A30_push_back_gawed_desc: "The Gawedi have always been in our minds, despite the fact we have not fought them for a long time.

We will defeat these statelets and divide the region as we see fit."

A30_dragon_coast_title: "Dragon Coast"
A30_dragon_coast_desc: "While our conquest of Reaver and Gnomish coasts was motivated by a desire to stop Kobold raids, we have realized that our ambitions could be larger.

A30_free_small_country_title: "Free the Small Country"
A30_free_small_country_desc: "The halflings of the Small Country have been under foreign occupation for centuries, but the empire can offer them a better alternative and autonomous rule. With the collapse of Lorent a power vacuum was left, we can either absorb the statelets that appeared in the empire directly or help the halflings create a united Small Duchy."

A30_unite_halflings_eco_title: "Unite the Halflings"
A30_unite_halflings_eco_desc: "For too long have the halflings been divided, both between foreign powers, internal struggles and culture, with the most recent example of that division being the one between Redfoots and Bluefloots. With the end of that political dichotomy a cultural rearrangement will inevitably happen, yet it is in our best interest that the Beefoot and Moonfoot pro-imperial attitudes dominate the new Small Country, for this reason we will help spread Imperial Halfling culture."

A30_strenghten_rose_connections_title: "Strenghten Rose Ties"
A30_strenghten_rose_connections_desc: "Even with the Lilac wars being over, we cannot forget our old allies. The members of the Rose party have been a valuable asset against Dameria and the moon party, we should reach out again and establish closer ties, for we lack long-term allies in the empire."

A30_invite_ibevar_title: "Invite Ibevar"
A30_invite_ibevar_desc: "The elves of Ibevar have long been isolationist and took little interest in the outside world, but this attitude has recently changed with their conversion to the Regent Court as well as their participation in the 4th Lilac War and their seizing of non-Elven land.\nWe will invite them in the empire, promising them political influence over all the Anbennarian elves as well as support against the Corvurians and Orcs."

A30_luna_river_identity_title: "Luna River Identity"
A30_luna_river_identity_desc: "Those who dwell along the Luna River are divided between East Damerian and Vernid cultural spheres, despite the fact that the river connects them and binds them in their day-to-day closer than they are to the core lands of Verne and Dameria. During the cultural revival of the post-Lilac War period and with the final collapse of Dameria and growth of Cestirande, the idea of Luna River nation or identity has started to be circulated among some intellectual communities in the Free cities dotting the river.\nThis emerging movement represents an opportunity for us to consolidate the rule of the Rose Party Cestirande in the region as well as the de-Damerization of the empire. The people of the Luna River will abandon their inorganic identities and instead adopt an identity that represent their true shared culture, Pashainey"

A30_second_imperial_arsenal_title: "Imperial Arsenal"

A30_moving_capital_title: "Moving Capital"
A30_moving_capital_desc: "To truly share power in the empire and to create a sense of unity and cohesion, we will move the capital of the empire every decade to a new location along the expanding Dove Road.

A30_pluricentric_anbennar_desc: "There are different concepts and understandings of what the empire of Anbennar is, for the Damerians it was merely an extension of their own realm, for the Lorentish it was a bunch of self-interested princes ready to sell each other out the second they could and for the magisters it's merely the less bad alternative to the chaos of the Wars of Rule.\nDespite these negative views of the Empire, we hold a far more optimistic view: the empire of Anbennar exists to defend and represent the interest of all of its constituent peoples that share in our beliefs in the gods of the Regent Court.\nThe empire must respect the autonomy of each of its constituent regions and must not be dominated by a single center.\nIn such an empire even the most stubborn Wexonard will be proud to be Anbennarian."

A30_restore_carneter_title: "Restore Carneter"
A30_restore_carneter_desc: "Carneter was an ancient post-Dragonwake kingdom flanked on each sides by Lorent and Dameria, it was almost inevitable for the old kingdom to eventually fall to one of these powers.\nSadly their peculiar culture and religious practices have been slowly abandoned over the centuries, yet with our support a new Duchy of Carneter is united under a local noble, formally separated from the de jure Grand Duchy of Dameria.\nFree once again, the new Carnetori which will be able to pursue cultural revitalization and create a modern Carnetori culture within the larger Anbennar milieu.\nWe will support the fusion of ancient Carnetori and present Anbennarian culture by exalting the West Damesheadic princes by moving the imperial capital to the region for one decade, defying the Lorentish military threat that long plagued both Carneter and Dameria."

The empire stretches from the grand peaks of the Khenak Mountains to the bustling harbors of Damescrown, and from the fertile lands of Lencenor to the cold forests of the Alenic Frontier.\n\nThe Dove Road connects the heartlands with the farthest provinces, fostering trade, culture, and communication. Along its paths, merchants, scholars, and nobles alike safely travel to and from every corner of the empire.

A30_conditional_loyalty_title: "More Rose Electors"
A30_conditional_loyalty_desc: "To secure our continued grasp on the emperorship, it is necessary to oust the disgruntled Moon party electors. One potential ally is Cestirande, a duchy infamous for its betrayal during the 4th Lilac War, when they joined the Rose party and fought their Damerian liege. They might be considered disloyal, but they simply follow their self-interest and as long as we can align our interest with theirs they will act as we expect them to. Alternatively, we could turn to the duchy of Seinathil, a principality ruled by the same Silistra dynasty ruling in Istralore. They harbor a longstanding rivalry with the Moon Party’s branch within their family and would be eager to aid our cause."

A30_corner_moon_party_title: "Corner Moon Electors"
A30_corner_moon_party_desc: "We will never truly be secure in our position as Emperor as long as Moonhaven and Istralore retain their roles as Electors. Both are staunch loyalists of Dameria and the Silmuna dynasty, and they will stop at nothing to undermine our rule. Their presence poses a constant threat, obstructing our efforts at every turn. The time has come to remove these thorns from our side and replace them with loyalists who will safeguard our reign and ensure the stability of the Empire under our control. Only then can we eliminate their influence and secure an unchallenged path forward."

This begins with reclaiming the imperial provinces that have fallen under foreign occupation and restoring them to their rightful place within the Empire. After having secured the borders of the empire, we will strengthen our eastern frontier by reinforcing the fortifications in Orda Aldresia.

Be it because of pure luck or the blessing of Munas or the Dame, the family managed to regroup and consolidate a new realm in Western Escann. Yet their luck or divine grace has run dry and they found themselves crossing our armies once again and their lands and dynasty lay under our control. \nNow it's time to decide what to do with them."

flavor_wex.521.a: "We must know the secrets of the druids"
flavor_wex.521.b: "The empire needs their woodwork"

flavor_wex.522.t: "Cela síl Plumwall"
flavor_wex.522.d: "The first thing Lothane III síl Wex notices when being presented with Cela síl Plumwall is her beauty. Flowing brown curls with streaks of purple and red frame an angelic face, while her piercing blue eyes catch the emperor's and hold them fixed. The Damerian farmlands are known for producing beautiful fruit, but she bears much more than plums, and far outpaces their charm.\n\nThe second thing Lothane notices is the distinctive smell of Diohuis brandy wafting gently over from where she stands, curtsied. It only grows stronger as she rises and makes her introduction in a melodic voice, presenting herself to the assembled court and entreatingly requesting a place amidst it. As he continues to stare, he cannot help but wonder whether it might be something else than blush that makes her cheeks glow so rosily, her smile spread so languorously. And then, of course, his keen eyes notice the small silver flask tucked away in the folds of her Esmari dress.\n\nThis woman is... intoxicating in more ways than one, even if she is intoxicated, and already the emperor feels his head set spinning by her presence. But he maintains enough sobriety to make a decision: can this woman stay? And if so, how close should he keep her?"
flavor_wex.522.a: "Lothane would love to share a cup of Diohuis with her. In his bed-chambers, tonight?"
flavor_wex.522.b: "Give her brandy aplenty, and set her loose with foreign diplomats!"
flavor_wex.522.c: "I may be intoxicated, but I know enough to say this: tell the empress to pack her bags!"
flavor_wex.522.e: "Send her back to Plumwall, lest she distract and drunken us all."

flavor_wex.523.t: "Ivrandil Saltsworn"
flavor_wex.523.d: "Not all the moon elves of Varivar were loyal Damerian subjects. Indeed, not all the moon elves of Varivar even spent the bulk of their lives on the Damesear. Or so [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has surmised from an hour of conversation with the recently-returned-to-port captain Ivrandil Saltsworn.\n\nThe elf is tanned much darker than most Moon Elves, almost appearing as a Sun Elf at first glance. He is as garrulous as most are poised, quick to share a story or a laugh. And he seems to have little sense of who the nominal ruler of Varivar is, and to care even less.\n\nHe apparently makes most of his living taking on the occasional transport of hazardous materials around the Divenhal, and in trading with Sea Elves - who [Root.Monarch.GetName] thought were merely rumor, but who Saltsworn seems to have broken bread with and (as he says with a laugh) even almost married one!\n\nHe is amenable enough to flying the Wex flag under his Varivari one, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has another proposition in store: what would he say to a refitted ship, in exchange for assisting the Imperial Navy in his downtime?"
flavor_wex.523.a: "Request he advises the Admiralty."
flavor_wex.523.b: "Give him a proper warship and have him lead our fleet!"

flavor_wex.524.t: "Godric sìl Acromton"
flavor_wex.524.d: "There is no zealot like a convert. Once, Godric síl Acromton was a Rubenairey lieutenant, whose brigade made the conquest of Acromton one of the Fourth Lilac War's more bloody affairs, fighting on long after Rubenaire switched signs and Acromton did too. He was captured but not killed, and spent a long stint in the prisons of Wexkeep. Lothane III síl Wex would have been content to keep him there until he expired, but as part of the gentle hand he took towards the region, he was recently released under strict supervision and bound to the duchy's land.\n\nApparently, as a free man he decided to walk every inch of the duchy, to see the land he loved so dear and had been so long apart from. What he saw astounded him â€” the land and people prospering and flourishing, as they had never done under the distant eyes of their Rubenairey overlords, who (Godric would attest) cared more about their next vintage than the totality of their East Damesear holdings. By the end of his journey across the land, he had become a fierce believer in the value of Wexonard rule in the region. He even challenged a man making disparaging comments about Lothane síl Wex's parentage to a duel, punishing the rudeness and insubordination with a deep scar across the man's face.\n\nUpon hearing this news, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors were quick to suggest his house arrest be lifted, and he be allowed to leave Acromton to serve in the armies of Wex. Godric's newfound zealousness certainly brought a smile to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face, but it his decision on whether this once-enemy should be allowed a place of honour in the armies he long fought against."
flavor_wex.524.a: "Keep your enemies close? Bring him to court, and maintain a tight watch on him."
flavor_wex.524.b: "Give him a place in the vanguard."

flavor_wex.525.t: "Revival of the Chivalric Kingdoms?"
flavor_wex.525.d: "The Greentide has destroyed countless lives and states, most important among them the major kingdoms of the late Chivalric period such as Farraneàn, Blademarches and Castellyr.\nMany among the Anbennarian nobles trace descent from refugees of the Greentide and they desire the restoration of these kingdoms and their ancestral titles."
flavor_wex.525.a: "It shall be done, the chivalric states shall be restored as Imperial Duchies!"
flavor_wex.525.b: "The adventurers have won the right to rule with their blood"
flavor_wex.525.c: "Alongside the Chivalric kingdoms, land will be granted to Orcs and Goblins that follow our ways!"
flavor_wex.525.a.tooltip: "We will seek to restore Chivalric kingdoms as we expand eastward"
flavor_wex.525.b.tooltip: "We will expand east by integrating existing states"
flavor_wex.525.c.tooltip: "We will recreate Chivalric kingdoms as well an Orcish and Goblin nation"

flavor_wex.526.t: "Buying the Folly?"
flavor_wex.526.d: "With our plans to reduce the curse of the Folly, we have received a suggestion from the Honderaak Gnolls to let them rule over the land and over their Flamemarked cousins, claiming that through their leadership the reclamation of the Folly will proceed more swiftly. We will have to buy the land from the princes that have attempted to settle it so far, but the gnolls are ready to pay half of the cost."
flavor_wex.526.a: "Yes, we can nab a trade port for ourselves too."
flavor_wex.526.b: "No, it's still too costly."

flavor_wex.527.t: "Swamp for the gnolls?"
flavor_wex.527.d: "Wex offers us to sell to the gnolls of Honderaak the swamps of Daravan's Folly, as they feel that the gnolls would be able to make better use of the land than the Humans. They offer 50 ¤ §YDucats§! per province."
flavor_wex.527.a: "Yes"
flavor_wex.527.b: "No"

flavor_wex.600.t: "The sins of the father"
flavor_wex.600.d: "Lothane's emperorship has been questioned throughout his life, yet even his death has not abated the criticism, especially among our fiercest enemies and the long living races that are slow to forget and forgive. We must work to improve our reputation in the empire."
flavor_wex.600.a: "We will manage"

flavor_wex.606.t: "Roilsardi Renaissance in Toarnen"
flavor_wex.606.d: "Toarnen has always been an odd fiefdom in the Borders, clinging to its Roilsardi root far stronger than any other Arannese principality did to any of their other ancestral groups. With the closer cooperation between the Roilsardi homeland and the rest of the empire the nobles of Toarnen have enjoyed the opportunity and privilege of helping bridge the 2 parties and acting as diplomats and administrators overseeing the integration of Roilsardi institutions within the imperial system. This has slowly lead to Toarnen abandoning any pretenses of being an Arannese nation and instead fully embracing their identity as Roilsardi, a constituent people of the Empire of Anbennar."
flavor_wex.606.a: "Are they three halfling tall once again?"

flavor_wex.608.t: "Our approach to the Order"
flavor_wex.608.d: "The Orda Aldresia remains a rotten den of Silmuna loyalists and its prestige and power is at the lowest, opening up an opportunity to flood the order with pro-Wex nobles.\nCastana, an Aldresian knight of Wexonard origin, could be supported in becoming the new Grandmaster although her loyalty to her homeland is second to her duty to the order. Alternatively we could force them to accepted one of our generals and use the order as the sword of the Emperor just like the Silmuna did during the Lilac Wars."
flavor_wex.608.a: "Castana will make the order a more neutral institution."
flavor_wex.608.b: "We will pressure them to accept one of our generals."
