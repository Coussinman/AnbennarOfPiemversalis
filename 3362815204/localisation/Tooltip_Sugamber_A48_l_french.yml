This not only serves to create two 'filters' of incompetent and corrupt officials, but also gives our subjects a feeling of input and self-determination whilst preventing any unruly elements from achieving office.\nThe best officials will also have the opportunity to be invited to be part of the royal Amber Court in Rhinmond and lend their talent to the prosperity of the realm."

sugamber_wexonard_kheteratan_empire_desc: "Having taken over the grand duchy with promises of imperial harmony and with many internal enemies it seemed like the age of expansion for Sugamber was over, yet the decline of the Crodamic rule in Kheterata opened a small opportunity for the Wexonard grand dukes and later 'kings' to both expand their power base, open up new markets for trade and to unravel the nature of Nerat.\nFollowing in the footstep of their ancient Crodamic cousins, the Sugambrians first conquered Deshak and then marched through the Salahad and seized the valley of the Mother's Sorrow, proclaiming themselves as inheritors of the Crodamic emperors that ruled Kheterata intermittently for about a millennium.\n\nYet rule by force is not stable and the Ryonard used their famed diplomatic skills to integrate the Crodamic and Kheteratan nobles in the new system.\nThe final act being the official unification of the Ryonard and Crodamic dynasties under one single dynasty through many marriages and political adoptions, with the Ryonard dynastic name being used in Cannor and Crodamos being used in Sarhal for the same dynasty members.\nThis dual dynastic name has helped attenuate fears in the empire of the existence of a second emperor ruling over land in the empire, as the Crodamic emperor only had this title because of his dynastic membership which only truly exists in Sarhal and not Cannor where the Ryonards are merely 'kings' in the Wexonard grand duchy."
