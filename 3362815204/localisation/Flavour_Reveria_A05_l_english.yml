A05_prepare_first_kobold_incursion_title: "Prepare the Kobold Wars"
A05_prepare_first_kobold_incursion_desc: "Our relations with the kobolds are a volatile at best; diplomacy with these lizards is difficult; the language barrier is severe and they seemingly attack both gnomes and humans on sight. The rest of Cannor would not blame us if we expelled or purged our scaly neighbors. But a handful of kobolds have managed to both learn common and engage peacefully with our people, we even have a handful kobold spies on our payroll, hinting at a potential for cohabilitation. Let us prepare our army thoroughly so we can crush theirs with minimal losses, and sign a law to decide on whether kobolds will play a role in our realm or not. \n\n§YIf we complete this mission whilst Expelling/Purging the kobolds, we will pursue a long term anti-kobold agenda, otherwise, we will try to incorporate the kobolds into the realm, however difficult it may be.§!"

A05_Reclaim_Drekiriki_title: "Reclaim Drekiríki"
A05_Reclaim_Drekiriki_desc: "The ancient Reaver Kingdom of Drekiríki once stood next to us, from 803 A.A. to 901 A.A. we had a brother to the north, but they were overrun by Redscales, let us now overrun these Redscales and bring Drekiríki in Gerudian hands once more!"

A05_A_New_Capital_title: "A New Capital"
A05_A_New_Capital_desc: "With Drekiríki firmly in our grasp, it has become even more evident what a true marvel of architecture this stone city is compared to our wooden lodgings in [Root.Capital.GetName]. It is also much more defendable against both the Lencori and the Alenics. Let us drive the kobolds out of the province and resettle it to prepare the city as our new capital."

A05_sustainable_economy_for_drekiriki_title: "Drekiríki Economy"
A05_sustainable_economy_for_drekiriki_desc: "With our administration moved and a large portion of our population taking up space in the city, it is now time to make sure there is a sustainable economy for our new capital. Let us establish a temple district and aid the construction of new businesses and markets."

A05_develop_the_dragonpoint_countryside_title: "Develop Dragonpoint"
A05_develop_the_dragonpoint_countryside_desc: "If the people of Drekiríki are to thrive, there needs to be a steady supply of goods flowing into the city from the surrounding countryside. It is essential that we develop the surrounding countryside accordingly, allowing our people to properly exploit the local resources."

A05_defending_the_capital_title: "Defending Our Lands"
A05_defending_the_capital_desc: "We have taken the first steps towards the settling of this land, however people are hesitant to truly invest into our new lands due to fear of foreign conquest. If we want to make the nobility feel safe enough to build estates and the people to feel safe enough to claim land in the rest of the newly acquired areas, we need to build proper defenses in our capital and in Royvibobb and Moorbobb."

A05_attract_gnomish_industry_title: "Gnomish Industry"
A05_attract_gnomish_industry_desc: "Before we took this city the Redscales used this great stone city built by the gnomes for fishing, a complete waste of potential according to our Cliff Gnomish advisors. They have drafted plans to repair some industrial buildings which have been gathering dust and kobold feces since the Kobold Rising in 404. The gem processing industry seems particularly promising. We should attempt to reinvigorate this industry."

A05_grant_artificers_privileges_title: "Satisfy Artificers"
A05_grant_artificers_privileges_desc: "Recently, not a day goes by that a Cliff Gnome has not appeared before [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] during court hours, asking for more legislation on a certain matter or for less legislation on another. Let us formulate proper legislation to ensure the Artificers both thrive and behave properly in our realm."

A05_gnome_mines_secured_title: "Secure the Gnome Mines"
A05_gnome_mines_secured_desc: "The time has come for [Root.GetName] to conquer the Kobold Caves and send word to gnomes and dwarves alike to start preparing for a new frontier of mining. We must push the Kobolds to the end of their hovel and then push them some more."

A05_damestear_demands_title: "Damestear Demands"
A05_damestear_demands_desc: "The same gnomish interest groups who were proponents of conquering the Kobold Caves are now complaining that the damestear supply cannot meet internal demands and that we must develop the industry of Baycodds or seek more sources of damestear elsewhere. If they say it is of vital economic interest, it probably is, and the mages seem to agree."

A05_coal_furnaces_title: "Dragon Furnaces"
A05_coal_furnaces_desc: "The gnomes need more coal for their industries and have proposed investing heavily into the coal-rich provinces of Royoddan and Kobilderd. Building this vital industry would not only please the gnomes, but also allow us to boost our weapon manufactories."

A05_a_gnomish_gift_title: "A Gnomish Gift"
A05_a_gnomish_gift_desc: "A bunch of gnomish interest groups have asked for a joint appointment at our court, both Cliffs and Creeks. [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] wonders what they might want now..."

A05_reconquer_the_gnomish_pass_title: "Reconquer Gnomish Pass"
A05_reconquer_the_gnomish_pass_desc: "We have held these lands for centuries, but in 1396 A.A. it was unlawfully wrested from our control by the Cliff Gnomes of Nimscodd who were at the time being assisted by the Gawedi. Now both the Reverian minorities in the region and wise local Cliffs still loyal to the rightful rulers of the Gnomish Pass are being oppressed by the Nimscodd Hierarchy, who wrongly claim to represent all Cliff Gnomes. We should reconquer the Gnomish Pass and show all of gnomekind, but especially those damn Nimscodds that the gnomes are our subjects as well."

A05_portnamm_secured_title: "Secure Portnamm"
A05_portnamm_secured_desc: "The prosperous city of Portnamm, the Portroy estuary, the paper farms and the Creek Gnomish ingenuity are all concentrated in this one place; we simply must seek to control this city. It would allow us to rake in taxes and trade, further legitimize our rule over the gnomes and help us defend ourselves against the Lencori. So what if it violates the Portroy Agreement."

A05_the_thought_tolerance_campaign_title: "Tolerance Campaign"
A05_the_thought_tolerance_campaign_desc: "With the integration of the Creeks in our realm, it has become painfully obvious that the Cliffs are less accepted than their Portnammer brethren. The Cliff Gnomish faith, or rather the lack thereof is a foreign concept in our society. We should write a decree of tolerance before societal tension arises, even though it may upset the clergy"

A05_grant_guild_rights_and_citzenship_to_gnomes_title: "Citizenship for Gnomes"
A05_grant_guild_rights_and_citzenship_to_gnomes_desc: "By granting the gnomes citizenship, we can ensure they can participate in our economy like any human can. This should prove a boon both to our economy and to the development of their enterprises."

A05_gnomes_in_the_army_title: "Gnomes in the Army"
A05_gnomes_in_the_army_desc: "It is time for the gnomes to find their place in our fearsome ranks, and by that we mean the back of our ranks. They have proven themselves knowledgeable on all matters artillery, and as such every artillery regiment shall henceforth be at least partly manned by gnomes. They are already drafting new designs, and they look expensive and... incomprehensible."

A05_gnomes_in_the_navy_title: "Gnomes in the Navy"
A05_gnomes_in_the_navy_desc: "A saying quickly developed ever since the first gnomes set foot on Reverian decks: "A gnome on deck keeps the water in check". It seemed evident that the gnomes were capable of maintaining and improving our vessels, even if they themselves preferred heavier ships. It is time to formally accept gnomes into our navy."

A05_integration_into_the_administration_title: "Gommo of Artificers"
A05_integration_into_the_administration_desc: "The gnomish inventors, manufacturers and mages, or "Artificers" as they like to be called, have been forced to operate through the legislation of the Magnates Guilds. They now stand before [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] emphasizing the need for them to get out of the stranglehold of Magnate supervision and forced guild fees for privileges not used. They ask to form their own Guild, or Gommo as they call it, The Gommo of Artificers. Perhaps we should give them this."

A05_the_gommo_of_portnamm_title: "Gommo of Portnamm"
A05_the_gommo_of_portnamm_desc: "The Creeks of Portnamm used to occupy most of the Iochand area, but even now that they have been pushed back to the Portroy estuary, the old saying "All paper leads to Portroy" still holds true. It's the largest paper source west of the Dameshead, and, with the onset of the Renaissance, both its demand for paper and its production of paper have increased tenfold. The Creeks wish to expand the paper farms, the printers and the school. If we aid their effort, we can turn Portnamm into a true center of progress!"

A05_the_gommo_of_drekiriki_title: "Gommo of Drekiriki"
A05_the_gommo_of_drekiriki_desc: "With the successful creation of the Gommo of Portnamm, a hugely complex institution with more paper than even the Stormpoint forests can supply, it seems doubly useful to build one of these "universities" in our capital; we should approve plans and start the construction as soon as affordable."

A05_attract_foreign_students_title: "Attract Foreign Students"
A05_attract_foreign_students_desc: "The gnomes have proven themselves the most inventive race on Halann in our eyes, but they claim that some knowledge held by elves and dwarves is foreign to them, we should establish relations with such peoples and exchange students."

A05_demand_for_precursor_relics_title: "Precursor Relics"
A05_demand_for_precursor_relics_desc: "As soon as the first expeditions to Aelantir brought precursor relics back to Cannor, word spread like wildfire. The Artificers and Mages tried to purchase them so they could study them, but nobody was selling, since they were seen as state assets by the expedition backers. If we want our Artificers and Mages to stay ahead of the curve, we need to go get them ourselves."

A05_southward_winds_title: "Southward Winds"
A05_southward_winds_desc: "With the rediscovery of Aelantir and its subsequent colonization, vast amounts of wealth have started to pour into the Cannorian coast. Piracy has never been this profitable, and some of our merchants have begun privateering the Westcoast. It has now become apparent that with our clearly superior navy, Reaver history, unique naval traditions and ship designs we are in a unique position to attempt to begin a second Age of Reavers. If we are to do so, we need to establish a base further south, so we can reach the Bay of Wines."

A05_moonisle_raiding_outpost_title: "Plan Moonisle Outpost"
A05_moonisle_raiding_outpost_desc: "With the outpost of Venáil conquered, we can begin raiding the surrounding coasts. However it has become evident that as these coasts are pillaged, vast amounts of wealth remain in the Dameshead Sea. We should seek to develop our Venáil outpost into a true port and use it as a staging ground to conquer Moonisle. Not only would this island be an ideal outpost to raid the southern half of the Dameshead Sea from, it is also rich in damestear. Let's hope the Emperor is busy."

A05_adrail_raiding_outpost_title: "Plan Adráil Outpost"
A05_adrail_raiding_outpost_desc: "With Moonisle taken, the riches of southern half of the Dameshead Sea are ours for the taking, but to raid the northern half successfully, we shall need another safe haven for our ships, the only obvious choice being the magister isle of Adráil. We should develop our Moonisle outpost to facilitate an invasion."

A05_reavers_of_the_dameshead_sea_title: "Reavers of the Dameshead Sea"
A05_reavers_of_the_dameshead_sea_desc: "With Moonisle and Adráil as havens for our ships, no riches are safe from the fearsome Reavers of Reveria. The sight of our ships now instill fear into any man who lives on the Dameshead coast or sails its sea."

A05_second_age_of_reavers_m_title: "Second Era of Black Ice"
A05_second_age_of_reavers_m_desc: "Not even in the wildest dreams of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s ancestors could they have imagined such an incredible Reaver fleet wreaking such devastating havoc on these coasts; it is truly the Second Era of Black Ice."

A05_acquire_nimscodd_title: "Acquire Nimscodd"
A05_acquire_nimscodd_desc: "The Cliff Gnomes were once our accomplices; they guided our ancestors to the most lucrative Lencori settlements when we first landed here, for a cut of the spoils. But over the ages our relations have soured. While we have treated the gnomes relatively well, the state of Nimscodd foolishly declared war upon us in 1396 A.A., making not the Cliff people but the Cliff state our natural enemy. To truly banish the idea of a Cliff state or even a gnomish state for that matter, we must conquer their isle; Nimscodd must fall."

A05_reaver_reunion_title: "The Reaver Reunion"
A05_reaver_reunion_desc: "With the Storm Isles under our control our merchants have re-established intensive contact with our Gerudian brethren. To [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s surprise a Reverian merchant brings us word from [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]. It is nothing more than a formal greeting, but if we send a cordial letter back and they like us enough, we could intensify our contact."

A05_reavers_and_the_mother_bear_title: "Reavers and the Bear"
A05_reavers_and_the_mother_bear_desc: "We have successfully navigated the strange diplomatic theater of our Gerudian cousins and have come out of it stronger than we were when we went in. During the process, our royal family and their entourage have gained appreciation of the Skaldhyrric faith, to the frustration of the Clergy."

A05_time_to_host_title: "Time to Host"
A05_time_to_host_desc: "With the Reaver Reunion as nothing more than a distant memory, it is time for [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to host a feast and invite Gerudian Konungr, Jarls and Skalds. Let our Gerudian cousins taste Lencori wine and women like we have, and experience what a Cannorian feast is like."

A05_research_reaver_bloodlines_title: "Reaver Bloodlines"
A05_research_reaver_bloodlines_desc: "The Tales of Reaver exploits during the Era of Black Ice (768 - 978 A.A.) spoken of during the feast interested our court greatly; the Skalds of Gerudia have remembered our stories better than we have ourselves. Our bloodline being occasionally mentioned as the Dragon Coast got discussed made it all the more interesting. If we wish to use these stories to our benefit, we must send chroniclers to Gerudia to obtain them in written form and "clarify" them if needed."

A05_reverian_crown_title: "Reaver Crown"
A05_reverian_crown_desc: "The tales documented by our chroniclers have made it abundantly clear that we need a crown that more adequately represents our Reaver heritage if we are to truly exploit it. We should a crown that represents both Reverian White and Drekiríki Red. If we wish to claim the Reaver thrones, we need a Reaver Crown."

A05_derhildes_bloodline_title: "Derhilde's Bloodline"
A05_derhildes_bloodline_desc: "Derhilde Reaverqueen settled Deranne in 861, and her Reaver blood still runs abundantly in the blood of the Derannic Nobles. If we are to truly claim the throne of [A02.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] in her name, we must first infiltrate their government and grease some palms."

A05_land_of_the_reaverqueen_title: "Land of the Reaverqueen"
A05_land_of_the_reaverqueen_desc: "With the land of the Reaverqueen in our domain we should incorporate some fitting ornaments to our Reaver Crown. We should seek out Derannic blue and green gems to add to our regalia. This would certainly bolster our prestige and legitimacy."

A05_henriks_bloodline_title: "Henrik's Bloodline"
A05_henriks_bloodline_desc: "Henrik Divenscourge founded the Kingdom of Pearlsedge in 879 after conquering part of the Tretunic Kingdom, and his Reaver blood still flows through the veins of the nobility of Pearlsedge. If we are to successfully claim [A11.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s throne in the name of Henrik, we must gain supporters among the nobility and prepare for a conflict with the Empire of Anbennar."

A05_divenscourge_pearls_title: "Divenscourge Pearls"
A05_divenscourge_pearls_desc: "With the fourth Reaver throne now under [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s figurative bum, it is time to decorate the regalia with some Pearlsedger white pearls to further bolster our legitimacy and prestige. Divenscourge's heritage lives on in us."

A05_the_last_claim_title: "The Last Claim"
A05_the_last_claim_desc: "Anbenncóst, the ceremonial capital of the Empire of Anbennar was once settled by Reavers. Even though they never left a lasting mark, their exploits are noteworthy. Anbenncóst was once a Reaver port, and it will be once again."

A05_eastward_winds_title: "Eastward Winds"
A05_eastward_winds_desc: "If we are to Reave more of the Divenhal Sea, we must gain outposts in it; our eyes have fallen on several places, such as the island of Bus-Akasu to gain access to Akasik, the island of Stingport to gain access to the Wyvern's Gulf and of course the incredibly prosperous Bay of Wines. We should wage war for some of these holdings to facilitate further incursions reminiscent of the Divenscourge Reaves of the previous millennia. To that end, we must prepare."

A05_tef_raiding_outpost_title: "Plan Tef Outpost"
A05_tef_raiding_outpost_desc: "The island of New Tefkora is ripe for the taking, it is in an ideal position to raid most of the Divenhal Sea safely. We should increase the logistical capacities of Bus-Akasu and infiltrate the government of [36.Owner.GetName]."

A05_pirail_raiding_outpost_title: "Beyond The Pass"
A05_pirail_raiding_outpost_desc: "With the subjugation of Tef behind us, it is time to look further east.\nThe Reavers of old had a vast network of Reaving outposts in the region, islands, archipelagos and peninsulas. Strategic locations that would offer our ships the range and safe harbor that they'd need to Reave these shores and make the people remember what "Divenscourge" means."

A05_reavers_of_the_divenhal_sea_title: "Reavers of the Divenhal Sea"
A05_reavers_of_the_divenhal_sea_desc: "With both New Tefkora and the some eastern Reaving outposts reestablished, we can safely reach most of the richest coasts of Sarhal. The Sun Elves and desertfolk now fear our sails!"

A05_Big_Friendly_Giant_title: "Big Friendly Giant"
A05_Big_Friendly_Giant_desc: "The states of Gawed and Lorent are always eying our lands. If we are to ensure that we do not become the target of either the rose or the eagle, we need to align ourselves with one of them."

A05_playing_our_cards_title: "Playing our Cards"
A05_playing_our_cards_desc: "If we are to ensure the survival of a Reverian state stuck between these two giants, we must use the rivalry of Gawed and Lorent against each other; if we can play one against the other, we weaken both whilst strengthening ourselves. Their kingdoms seem infallible, but in truth halflings on every side of every border are itching for a rebellion. Let's use that hate for our own gain with clever propaganda."

A05_the_chance_of_a_century_title: "The Chance of a Century"
A05_the_chance_of_a_century_desc: "The halflings have risen up! Now is the time to break the false dichotomy; we are not either puppets of Lorent or Gawed! We can be masters of our own fate, together with others brave enough to resist, and those others have just shown themselves! We go to war! For Small Country! For Reveria!"

A05_ruined_sea_raiding_title: "Ruined Sea Raiding"
A05_ruined_sea_raiding_desc: "Stories of a sea with islands so numerous one can hardly count them have arrived in [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s court. Surely these islands would be a great asset to privateer right at the source of all this newfound wealth, Aelantir. We should establish some colonies."

A05_struggle_for_the_ruined_isles_title: "Struggle for the Isles"
A05_struggle_for_the_ruined_isles_desc: "The isles of this Ruined Sea do indeed show potential as privateering bases, however we are not the only ones colonizing these isles. We must settle more islands if we wish hold on to our assets, and if an island is occupied, we should wrest it from their control."

A05_asserting_dominance_title: "Asserting Dominance"
A05_asserting_dominance_desc: "Our policies regarding the Ruined Isles appear to be working, and our privateers can function more effectively because of it. The more we own, the more our treasury grows. We must continue the effort."

A05_island_hopping_title: "Island Hopping"
A05_island_hopping_desc: "The majority of the Ruined Isles now lie within our domain, and our privateers can act almost unhindered in their heinous affairs. These islands clearly belong to us, everyone should be able to see that, but some fools remain ignorant. Let us show them our Marines."

A05_reverian_ruined_sea_title: "Reverian Ruined Sea"
A05_reverian_ruined_sea_desc: "The Reverian control over the Ruined Sea and its isles is now truly undisputed. Our Marine regiments are some of the world's finest and our privateers can raid even the surrounding seas mostly unhindered. This sea is unequivocally Reverian."

A05_we_do_a_little_trolling_title: "We Do a Little Trolling"
A05_we_do_a_little_trolling_desc: "Whenever a new destination becomes commonplace for our people, it seems to become a verb. One goes "Dalyring" when he ships goods and people from and to Dalyre. One goes "Ruining" when he sails to the ruined sea to privateer from The Thousand Ports. Now a new verb is being uttered by our people: "Trolling", the act of sailing to the rich Trollsbay to privateer the local shipments. It is time for our navy to try this "Trolling"."

A05_mocbarja_dam_title: "Mocbarja Dam"
A05_mocbarja_dam_desc: "Our Ynnic Reavers are being blocked from going north by the dam the locals call the Mocbarja dam. We must control this dam if we wish to continue to raid the Ynn in this direction. Let us conquer the dam and prepare the Northern Ynnic Raid."

A05_the_last_dragon_of_aelantir_title: "Last Dragon of Aelantir"
A05_the_last_dragon_of_aelantir_desc: "If we are to find this dragon, we need to gain control of the local area so we can then search all temples, hills, caves and forests. Let us conquer these lands and exact revenge upon this winged beast."

A05_picking_up_the_pieces_title: "Picking Up the Pieces"
A05_picking_up_the_pieces_desc: "Tretun used to be a part of Henrik Divenscourge's land; as such we now have a natural claim to this area. This land was Reaver land, and so it shall be ours."

A05_reaver_empire_title: "Reaver Empire"
A05_reaver_empire_desc: "We control all the Wescann(Western Cannor) lands that were owned by Reavers during the Era of Black Ice. The four crowns of Reveria, Drekiríki, Deranne & Pearlsedge are united into one great Reaver empire.\n\nThis calls for a feast and ceremony!"

A05_gnoll_sails_title: "Gnollish Sails"
A05_gnoll_sails_desc: "Ever since our conquest of Bus-Akasu, our Reavers have been reporting that they would be a lot more effective if the gnolls did not harass them or raid their targets. It is time for us to show these gnolls we own the seas."

A05_black_sails_title: "Black Sails"
A05_black_sails_desc: "The black sails of Nathalaire are major hindrance to the profitability of the Tef raiding outpost. We will show these pirates the way of the Reaver. If they wish to raid our seas, then they must pay us dues."

A05_the_reaver_fleet_title: "The Reaver Fleet"
A05_the_reaver_fleet_desc: "The fleets of our ancestors were once the scourge of Cannor. If we are to bring about a new era of Reverian naval dominance, we must first expand our navy. Doing so would even allow us to revive the ancient tradition of Reaving §Y(Raiding Coasts)§!."

A05_westward_winds_title: "Westward Winds"
A05_westward_winds_desc: "The winds of the Westcoast usually blow westwards. With the discovery of Lonely Isle we should seek to take it for our own and use it as a gateway to the elven homeland, which is rumored to be westwards of us. Let the wind take our sails!"

A05_land_spotted_title: "Land Spotted!"
A05_land_spotted_desc: "The ancient homeland of the Elves is truly within our grasp now, and untold riches could be within reach. We must explore these foreign lands as quickly as we can. Our people surely seem to agree; the price of ships at the docks of [Root.Capital.GetName] have already doubled!"

A05_nostalgic_cold_title: "Nostalgic Cold"
A05_nostalgic_cold_desc: "The cold in this area our people have begun to call Dalyre reminds people of the cold that our Gerudian cousins endure. As more people venture out to settle the area, an act which is now being called "Dalyring", we will have to thoroughly manage these ventures so the frost does not take them, not to mention those deformed elves."

A05_a_promising_river_title: "A Promising River"
A05_a_promising_river_desc: "After finding no signs of true civilization since their departure from [Root.Capital.GetName], our explorers have come across a river in the province they dubbed Verencel whose beds are filled with various trinkets such as pottery, dolls and fishing nets. This is a promising river, we should send an expedition upstream. Some are already volunteering."

A05_purchasing_a_map_title: "Purchasing a Map"
A05_purchasing_a_map_desc: "We have established contact with the locals. They are indeed far more civilized than the people we have been encountering before, even though they look virtually the same. We have established contact through the use of translation magic and now we must see to acquire a map, so we know how to proceed."

A05_prepare_logistics_title: "Prepare Logistics"
A05_prepare_logistics_desc: "It has become very clear to us, the river we found is of mild strategic interest, but the true treasures lie on the river beyond here, the Ynn, as they call it. We must prepare a logistical network so we can exert our influence upon this grand river."

A05_vareynn_secured_title: "Vareynn Secured"
A05_vareynn_secured_desc: "With a city on the Ynn secured our merchants have already started trading Ynnic goods. More importantly however, the logistics for an expedition downstream have been taken care of, so it is time for the First Ynnic Raid!"

A05_damned_dam_title: "Damned Dam"
A05_damned_dam_desc: "Our first Ynnic raid was a bit of a disappointment, partially due to the hostile monsters in these rivers, but largely due to that damned dam; we must seek to conquer this dam and prepare another raid."

A05_vels_bacar_dam_title: "Vels Bacar Dam"
A05_vels_bacar_dam_desc: "The second Ynnic Raid was a huge success, but if we are to go further south, we must control the dam in Vels Bacar; let us accomplish this and raid even further south."

A05_the_fate_of_the_dome_title: "The Fate of the Dome"
A05_the_fate_of_the_dome_desc: "It is time we wrest control of the castle of Stanyrhrada out of the hands of the Ynnics and into ours. Only then can we take the Ynn's most prized possession."

A05_subjugation_of_the_ynn_desc: "With the dams of the Ynn in our hands, the natives have no choice but to interact with us. We should seek to conquer the entire Ynn so this breadbasket of food can be ours forever."

A05_sarhali_exploitation_committee_title: "Found the S.E.C"
A05_sarhali_exploitation_committee_desc: "When the first Cannorian expeditions to South Sarhal that managed to return did so, they brought back tales of gnolls, gargantuan overgrown coastal stone cities, dark-skinned humans and even dark-skinned halflings. \nThese awe inspiring stories are now inspiring our most wealthy and venturous people to undertake expeditions and create outposts, plantations and ports of their own. \nIf we unite these people into a Committee we can better compete with the locals and other Cannorian colonists."

A05_reaver_tef_title: "The Divenhal Kingdom"
A05_reaver_tef_desc: "The Reaver Kingdom of the Divenhal Sea, commonly known as the Divenhal Kingdom, was the last formed of the great Reaver kingdoms of the Era of Black Ice. With holdings all across its namesake, the Divenhal Sea, its most notable holdings were the Isle of Tef and the Isle of Ibtat, now known as Elizna.\nIn 890 A.A., A Reaver fleet under command of Halfdal Henriksson, son of the legendary Henrik Divenscourge, composed of Perlatter, Talderannic and even Reverian ships managed to conquer the Isle of Tef, and soon after Reaved through much of the east Divenhal.\n With the Divenscourge tales firmly embedded into our national spirit, it is now the time to emulate these conquests.\n\nEborthil has had seven Reaver Kings, why not eight?"

A05_Thought_2_1_title: "Stimulate Ingenuity"
A05_Thought_2_1_desc: "The Reverian people have been outcompeted by Gnomish Ingenuity for centuries, but this paradigm is changing. Ever since we incorporated their lands into our own, their cultural values have been seeping into us as well.\n With every invention our artificers make, Reverians start to value education, ingenuity and innovation more and more.\n\nPerhaps we can stimulate this further?"

A05_Thought_3_2_desc: "While previously we have been teaching our colonies about the Philosophy of The Thought, sometimes it is us who are being taught.\n Our colonies and dependencies come into contact with religions that they themselves try to Harmonize with, by more closely knitting our policies we can Harmonize these faiths too."

A05_Thought_4_1_desc: "The Thought is an ancient philosophical system stemming from the old Gnomish Hierarchy, and is based on the idea that pursuing knowledge and rational Thought is the path to enlightenment and ultimate fulfillment. Followers of The Thought believe in using logic and reason to understand the world around them and to make decisions that will lead to the betterment of themselves and society as a whole. Sentience is essential as it allows for the ability to understand, reason, and make choices that contribute to the greater good and progress of society. Often mistakenly considered a “religion” by many, it is rather a philosophy, that can be combined with many different faiths without issue.\n\n§YConverting§! to §YThe Thought§! can be done through one of the following ways:\n Converting to the §YThe Thought§! sometime after adopting the §YGnomish Co-Goverment§! when one of your §YThe Thought advisors§! tries to convert you\n Exposing your §YHeir§! to §YThe Thought§! through the §YGommo of Portnamm§!\nHaving a majority of your §Ydevelopment§! be §YThe Thought§! and succumbing to their §Yrebels§!, who can appear when trying to convert their provinces.\n\nThis §YMission Branch§! is especially recommended for players who plan on extensively using the §YArtificery System§!, §Yintegrating§! the §YKobolds§! and §Ycolonizing§! lots of §YAelantir§!."

#Reveria Events
reveria.1.t: "The Revrland Claim"
reveria.1.d: "[Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Bjarnrík has invited [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to a feast in [Z08.Capital.GetName] to which most of the Gerudian rulers have also been invited. [Root.GetRulerOrRegency] has been enjoying Gerudian dishes and is having loads of fun comparing them to their Reverian counterparts or mentioning the lack thereof. After the dinner the [Root.GetRulerOrRegency] is conversing with [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] when a Skald sits with the two and begins diverting the conversation to the Era of Black Ice. The story is mildly interesting but takes a turn for the better when the Skald casually mentions a direct ancestor of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], Jarl Einar of house Fuglborg, who once ruled over the lands of Revrland, which since the birth of the Pirate Republic of Revrhavn has been without legitimate ruler...\n [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] notices the tension in the air as [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] realizes the implications of this: this Skald just casually gave a claim on Revrland to [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]!"
reveria.1.a: "So [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], when am I getting my birthright back?"
reveria.1.b: "That was generations ago, no claim lasts that long."

reveria.2.t: "The [Z13.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]'s insult"
reveria.2.d: "[Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Redgarhavn has insulted [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] gravely when they mentioned at full volume that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] presence was a disgrace and that heathens should not be allowed on Gerudian soil so important. The Reverian [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] and the other guests tried to defuse the situation, but the [Z13.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] continued, no doubt fueled largely by alcohol, saying that the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]'s accent was preposterous and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] clothing an affront to all Gerudians."
reveria.2.a: "An affront to Gerudian traditions you say? Why don't we settle this in a traditional Holmgang?"
reveria.2.b: "I do not mind these insults from somebody too drunk to think clearly."

reveria.3.t: "The Holmgang"
reveria.3.d: "[Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] and [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Redgarhavn have sailed to Giant's Manse on separate vessels, as [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Bjarnrík did not allow [Z08.Monarch.GetHerHis] feast to end in a Holmgang on [Z08.Monarch.GetHerHis] own lands. It is now time for [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to battle for their honor, or perhaps even [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life!"

reveria.6.d: "With the Reaver Reunion as nothing more than a distant memory, it was time for [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to host a feast of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own and invite Gerudian Konungr, Jarls and Skalds. The first guests have already arrived and the mood is exactly as [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] planned for it. Those who have proven enemies of the house have obviously not been invited, but nonetheless the halls of the Castle of [Root.Capital.GetName] still fill with Gerudians. They taste of Lencori wine for the first time and enjoy the entertainment of our short friends more than the Reverians could have anticipated. The skalds tell of ancient Tales of Reavers during the Era of Black Ice that captivate the entirety of the court, including [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]. Many Tales and facts lost to the Reverians have been meticulously handed down generations of Skalds. As the evening sets and our guests go out to "explore" the various noteworthy establishments in [Root.Capital.GetName] or return to their ships, they all thank [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hospitality. A successful feast, it seems."
reveria.6.a: "Reverians truly host great feasts"

reveria.7.t: "Dome of Stanyrhrada Exported"
reveria.7.d: "The vile Reverians have plundered our river settlements, our temples, our relics and our honour.

Our pride will never recover."

reveria.8.t: "Research Expedition to Gerudia"
reveria.8.d: "[A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has sent an expedition of chroniclers to the Skalds of Gerudia to document all matters related to the bloodlines of the Reavers. The lineages of the Reaver kingdoms of Reveria, Deranne, Pearlsedge, Drekiríki and even the Divenhal Kingdom of old have been carefully documented and brought back to court. After that the court spymaster has gone over the fine details of all family trees, carefully accentuating or where necessary editing details about centuries past to ensure the Síl Revers and thus our realm have a legitimate claim on all Reaver Kingdoms.\n\n Plenty of marriages happened between the three great Reaver Dynasties: The Askeling dynasty to which the síl Revers belong is deeply intertwined with the Derhilding dynasty and thus its present house of síl Deranne, for example through the wedding of Daghr Alvorsson Askeling and Princess Cora of Deranne. \n\nOther houses, such as Divenscourge houses of Pearlman(Pearlsedge) who birthed the Síl Na Trísfer cadet branch and of course House Taefdares(Eborthil and the Divenhal Kingdom), have less of a link to the Síl Rever house and will need more propaganda to legitimize a claim.\n\n The goal is to spread these findings inconspicuously, with our claims not yet emphasized, which will hopefully result in raising knowledge about our glorious past and establishing the fabrications as fact."
reveria.8.a: "Now to disseminate it..."

reveria.9.t: "The Reaver Crown"
reveria.9.d: ""The crown is finally here!" A servant exclaims as he storms into [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s courtroom. A minute later a box carried by the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]'s most trusted men is opened and a beautiful crown is revealed. A Reverian White crown with Drekiríki Red ornaments, truly a new height for the regalia collection of Reveria. The old crown is quickly handed away to a servant and the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] dons the Crown. Truly a Reaver Crown."
reveria.9.a: "Taxes well spent!"

reveria.10.t: "The Fate of the Border"
reveria.10.d: "With the recognition of the Small Country state and the formalization of our alliance, a small but vital discussion between diplomats has ensued over the fate of Turnwell and Manerd, two provinces which some claim belong to Small Country. We should handle this issue before tension arises."
reveria.10.a: "Cede the provinces and move all non-halflings to our capital"

reveria.10.c: "If only we even held the provinces of Manerd and Turnwell"

reveria.11.t: "Formalize Artificery in Reveria"
reveria.11.d: "It is time to formalize the Artificery guild; the gnomes have earned it. Moreover, it can lead to more innovation and a stronger military. The gnomes will henceforth know they are thoroughly respected by the Reverian state."
reveria.11.a: "These documents always require way too many signatures"

reveria.12.t: "A New Capital?"
reveria.12.d: "With the conquest of Drekiríki behind us, several interest groups have mentioned both the necessity of developing Drekiríki and the possibility of it one day becoming our new capital. Proponents of the move advocate that it would be a more defendable location and that the Oddanroy estuary paired with the ancient foundations built by the gnomes will make these stone ruins a better capital than our current capital."
reveria.12.a: "First we need to clear the kobolds and repair vital parts of the city"

reveria.13.t: "A New capital!"
reveria.13.d: "The city of Drekiríki has been prepared for our government. The streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] now overflow with the carts of migrating Reverians while the docks see brown with ships carrying far too much cargo aboard. Across the entire state, people are migrating to Drekiríki to claim a piece of the city."
reveria.13.a: "It may be a step forward, but I'll miss it here"

reveria.14.t: "The Cliff Migration"
reveria.14.d: "Following the decree signed by the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency], declaring that the Dragon Coast is safe, a mass migration of Cliff Gnomes from the isle of Nimscodd is starting to take form. These gnomes are more than willing to fight for their ancestral homeland, and deal with local kobolds with a vast array of experimental weapons. As remaining hovels are burned to ash the gnomes are already planning new farms and industries."
reveria.14.a: "I for one welcome our new underlings"

reveria.15.t: "But we don't have Darkvision!"
reveria.15.d: "The gem industry of Drekiríki has proven lucrative, however the meager supply of raw gems is seriously hampering the economy, according to a prominent Cliff Gnome industry representative. Presenting documents that show ancient expeditions into the kobold caves revealed plenty of gems, he urges [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to conquer the caves so the economy can be bolstered with gems and metals. His arguments are sound and so [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] accepts the documentation and begins planning, even if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is worried about the implications of fighting kobolds with darkvision in their dark hovels."
reveria.15.a: "Let us conquer these caves"

reveria.16.t: "A Gnomish Gift"
reveria.16.d: "As [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] enjoys the momentary respite of an empty court, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hears a commotion outside the courtroom. The [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] instinctively reaches for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword, but as the source of the commotion bursts into the room it becomes clear this is not a threat, this is a gift! A large amount of gnomes enter the throne room carrying various items packed in wrapping paper that are laid out on the table before the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]. The gnomes explain that they are grateful for the continued support of their people by the Reverian state and would like to return the favor. The [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] begins unpacking the gifts and concludes that despite half of the gifts coming from the Creeks being various forms of pranks, the overall collection of gifts is a remarkable collection of useful items. The Gnomes explain that they have collected various experimental tools that can aid in the administration of the realm."
reveria.16.a: "I'm so glad we didn't purge them"

reveria.17.t: "The First Ynnic Raid"
reveria.17.d: "With Vareynn secured and the raid prepared, our boats set sail for the First Ynnic Raid. Spirits are high on the boats as they cruise downstream, banter being exchanged from vessel to vessel about which crew is going to haul the most loot. All of these pleasantries die down as the first warning of the Vareynn natives proves true: Serpents the length of the boats and even stranger creatures they could never hope to describe begin attacking the boats as they make their way to the town of Stantirshalas. The timid fleet takes several losses as a couple of boats capsize; some crew swim to other boats and manage to climb aboard, others aren't as lucky and are dragged below or lose limbs during their escape. Morale has dropped significantly; the natives weren't trying to dissuade us from raiding their peoples by spreading scary lies, they were spreading scary truths. The captain of the raid makes new rules and distributes them as quietly to the rest of the boats as possible: "No unnecessary noise, no loud paddling, spearmen at the sides of the boats ready to strike into the water." With these rules the raid progresses relatively successfully, all went rather well and the natives handed over their belongings without too much struggle. Until after a bend in the river another warning given by the Vareynn natives proves true: A huge manmade dam blocking the entire river, with a city entirely built on stilts standing before it in the Ynn. The local swamp also appeared to be inhabited by long green creatures with large mouths, who bathed on the riverside, making the whole situation rather claustrophobic. With the men exhausted and morale low, the fleet decided to head back for Vareynn, richer in gold, information and experience, but poorer in men and limbs."
reveria.17.a: "This could have been worth it, if it wasn't for that damned dam."

reveria.18.t: "The Second Ynnic Raid"
reveria.18.d: "With the lessons learned from the First Ynnic Raid and the conquest of the dam of Bosancovac complete, the time has finally come for the second raid. The fleet has been preparing ever since to make sure this one will be successful. Our crews are bolstered by Ruinborn Ynnics who know these waters well and provide impromptu advice. Our boats now sail closer together so that the spearmen from our vessels can support one another. With these strategies in place and a dozen more precautions taken, the raid appears to be going splendidly. As the raiders raid the various southward estuaries before continuing southwards, they find themselves blocked by a dam, the Vels Bacar dam. The fleet turns around and takes a different route, north. Many more days of raiding go by and eventually another dam is reached, the Mocbarja dam. With all of their opportunities exhausted the fleet decides to head back to Bosancovac. This raid was a resounding success; some ruinborn settlements were too well fortified to plunder and some beasts too fierce to kill, but in the end the Reavers return victoriously."
reveria.18.a: "Time to conquer some more dams"

reveria.19.t: "The Southern Ynnic Raid"
reveria.19.d: "With the Vels Bacar Dam in our domain our Ynnic Reaver fleet can raid the southern reaches of this subcontinent. At this point the logistics of our raids are honed to near perfection so the raid goes rather smoothly, but the southern Ynnics put up a valiant fight in some of the more developed settlements. When our men sail towards the fiefdom of Stanyrhrada, a marvelous golden glistening blinds them as the sun reflects off of a great golden dome atop the city's castle. It has now become clear that the golden domes seen in other Ynnic settlements were mere imitations. When put under pressure, the locals tell us it is a magical dome from a bygone era, which allegedly casts an aura of magical fortune over the region. Sadly due to the significant fortifications of the castle, our raiders cannot obtain it. It is as desirable as it is out of reach; we simply must come back for this dome."
reveria.19.a: "We'll be back, for that dome"

reveria.20.t: "The Northern Raid"
reveria.20.d: "The Mocbarja Dam is securely in our grip, the men are restless and the treasury could use some fattening; it is time for the Northern Raid. Our men set out from Mocbarja and raid several areas over the following days, the most profitable one being the dense city of Svemel. A curious detail about this area is that these people do not worship the Ynn, they instead appear to worship dragons. As such a lot of the loot comes in the form of various types of dragon art: pots with dragons painted on, glass or iron figurines of dragons and relics from bygone eras. The raid went well, with minimum casualties, and now it is time to head back to Mocbarja..."
reveria.20.a: "These ruinborn are no match for us"

reveria.21.t: "Dragon sighted!"
reveria.21.d: "As the boats sail downstream back to Mocbarja, a dragon is spotted in the distant sky, approaching fast. Soon the fleet is set ablaze by this fearsome green beast, as Reavers jump into the water, preferring sea serpents to this sky serpent. Our troops hopelessly pelt it with projectiles as the dragon comes back for a second fly-by and then a third, before deciding it has had enough and begins to fly off. The captains begin to shout orders."
reveria.21.a: "Save yourselves!"
reveria.21.b: "Haul the loot off of the burning boats!"

reveria.22.t: "The Dragonsearch"
reveria.22.d: "We have conquered the admirers of the winged beast, yet we have not found it. Our men now search every temple, hill, cave and forest. After weeks of searching the dragon still has not been found, but countless trinkets made of actual dragon parts such as green scales, teeth and claws are now in our possession. What should we do with them?"
reveria.22.a: "Sell these trinkets to the highest bidder"
reveria.22.b: "The [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] wants them for [A05.Monarch.GetHerHis] collection"

reveria.23.t: "Transporting the Dome"
reveria.23.d: "Now that the dome is in our possession we must figure out how we are moving this humongous relic back to [Root.Capital.GetName]."
reveria.23.a: "[Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]: "I will go there and move it myself""
reveria.23.b: "Our artificers are both capable and willing to move it, let them handle it."
reveria.23.c: "We own can send it downstream on the Ynn and tow it from Ynnsmouth to [Root.Capital.GetName] by ship."
reveria.23.e: "Let the mages teleport it"
reveria.23.f: "We'll have to tow it up the Ynn and cart it back to Verencel and then tow it to [Root.Capital.GetName] by ship."

reveria.24.t: "Selling the dome?"
reveria.24.d: "Now that we have the dome in [Root.Capital.GetName], should we keep or sell it?"
reveria.24.a: "Incorporate it into [Root.Capital.GetName]'s castle"
reveria.24.b: "Sell it to the highest bidder"

reveria.25.t: "Reaver Reunion"
reveria.25.d: "The merchants of Reveria have intensified contact with our markets after their conquest of the Storm Isles. [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] and [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Reveria have since been exchanging letters, and slowly an idea for a feast started forming in their heads. A feast to celebrate the return of the Reavers. [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] will indeed host one."
reveria.25.a: "[Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] is looking forward to it"

reveria.26.t: "Reveria Claims Revrland!"
reveria.26.d: "During our feast, the Reverian [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] heard from a Skald that [A05.Monarch.GetSheHe] can trace a claim to Revrland through [A05.Monarch.GetHerHis] paternal bloodline. In a moment of utter rudeness, [A05.Monarch.GetSheHe] recognized [A05.Monarch.GetHerHis] claim for all to hear!"
reveria.26.a: "Do the Reverians have no decency at all?"

reveria.27.t: "The Holmgang Challenge"
reveria.27.d: ""If I am an afront to Gerudian traditions, then why don't we settle this in a traditional Holmgang?" [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] hears [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Reveria say to them after [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] spent the last few minutes insulting every aspect of the Reverian culture in a drunken tirade at a feast in [Z08.GetCapitalName]."
reveria.27.a: "You Reverians forgot our faith, you bastards probably forgot how to fight as well! Bring it!"
reveria.27.b: "I-I... I refuse"

reveria.28.t: "Redgarhavn Refuses Holmgang"
reveria.28.d: "The cowardly [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Redgarhavn has refused our Holmgang challenge, like a despicable coward!"
reveria.28.a: "You would have lost, anyhow"

reveria.29.t: "The End"
reveria.29.d: "As [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] lies on the ground, at [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s mercy, [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] raises their axe and slams it down onto [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s neck."
reveria.29.a: "A sad day for Reveria"

reveria.30.t: "Spared but Humiliated"
reveria.30.d: "[Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Redgarhavn has defeated [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], but luckily for [A05.GetRulerOrRegency], [Z13.Monarch.GetSheHe] has decided the humiliation of defeat is enough. [Z13.GetRulerOrRegency] sits down with [Z13.Monarch.GetHerHis] people as they tend the wounds from the duel, paying no attention to [A05.GetRulerOrRegency], who stumbles back to their ship, blood trailing behind [A05.Monarch.GetHerHim]."

reveria.31.d: "[A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Reveria has defeated [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], but luckily for [Z13.GetRulerOrRegency], [A05.Monarch.GetSheHe] has decided the humiliation of defeat is enough. [A05.GetRulerOrRegency] sits down with [A05.Monarch.GetHerHis] people as they tend the wounds from the duel, paying no attention to [Z13.GetRulerOrRegency], who stumbles back to their ship, blood trailing behind [Z13.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
reveria.31.a: "Reverians are the worst"

reveria.32.t: "Reveria Takes Giant's Manse"
reveria.32.d: "When [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Reveria beat [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], they did not demand death, nor dishonor. Instead opting to take the isle of the duel for themselves. It is uncommon but not unprecedented in Gerudian tradition, and [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has no choice but to accept."
reveria.32.a: "We will get it back, one way or the other."

reveria.33.t: "No mercy for the drunk"
reveria.33.d: "When [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Reveria beat [Z13.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], they killed [Root.GetRulerOrRegency] in cold blood! Such disrespect will never forgotten."
reveria.33.a: "We will never forget this"

reveria.34.t: "Reverian Diplomacy"
reveria.34.d: "The Reverians offered us an alliance in our time of need, bringing much needed support to our war effort. As our diplomats were discussing the fate of the historically halfling provinces of Turnwell and Manerd with them, it was decided that Reveria would extract the non-halfling people out of the land and then hand it over to us, the rightful owners of the land. What a trustworthy people."
reveria.34.a: "We could not ask for better allies"

reveria.35.t: "Reverian Diplomacy"
reveria.35.d: "The Reverians offered us an alliance in our time of need, bringing much needed support to our war effort. As our diplomats were discussing the fate of the historically halfling provinces of Turnwell and Manerd with them, it was decided that Reveria would compensate the extraction of the local halflings and pay a hefty sum of gold for Small Country to relinquish their claims to it."
reveria.35.a: "We really needed the crowns"

reveria.36.t: "Reports from Small Country"
reveria.36.d: "Reports from out spy network operating in Small Country indicate that rebellious organisations within halfling society are beginning to form. This might be the only opportunity we'll ever get to disrupt the status quo in the region. [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s best advisors recommend not engaging in any activity that could result in a truce with the oppressors of the halflings, as this could hamper our geopolitical maneuverability if a large halfling revolt occurs and we wish to support them. Several halflings have offered their service to the court, hoping for support in the potential upcoming war."
reveria.36.a: "It would be wise to bide our time and watch our truces"

reveria.37.t: "Gnomes in the government?"
reveria.37.d: "The gnomes of the realm have been taking up exceedingly vital positions recently and they hold those positions well. Their administrative skill is undeniable and their innovativeness is unrivaled in the realm. Gnomes are petitioning for more governmental positions and they want gnomish personnel to assist them. Should we embed the gnomes deeply in our government, or try to retain a [Root.Culture.GetName] monolingual government?"
reveria.37.a: "Let the gnomes fuse with our government"
reveria.37.b: "The government is functional as is"

reveria.38.t: "The Old Faith"
reveria.38.d: "With the plenitude of Tales from Gerudia being studied by [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s chroniclers and spymaster, [A05.Monarch.GetSheHe] [A05.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has also grown interested in these Tales of old. The stories feature giants, dragons and other beasts that [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] grew up hearing about. Even some ancestors are mentioned in these tales, and they're all in Gerudian too, which makes them pleasant to read. The Skaldhyrric faith might be incompatible with Cannorians, yet it is reconcilable with Reverian traditions and folklore."
reveria.38.a: "Fascinating stuff"
reveria.38.b: "This was the faith of my ancestors, now it is mine too"
reveria.38.c: "Let us harmonize their tales"

reveria.39.t: "The Faith of the State"
reveria.39.d: "With [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s recent conversion to the Skaldhyrric faith, the fate of the state is now unclear. Will the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] enforce [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal beliefs upon the Reverians, or let them decide for themselves?"
reveria.39.a: "Let the people decide for themselves"
reveria.39.b: "The Old Faith must be restored!"
reveria.39.c: "Let us Harmonize their Tales"

reveria.40.t: "The Theory of Everything"
reveria.40.d: "With the gnomes taking up a more prominent role in society as of late, and with the plenitude of gnomes making their way into [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s court, the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] has been getting exposed to the gnomish philosophy of The Thought. [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has been developing an interest in the philosophy, and to the dismay of the clergy is spending more and more time with gnomish thinkers. The Thought is a very tolerant school of thought, which does not infringe on the belief in the Cannorian Pantheon or any belief for that matter, however the clergy still deeply dislike the doctrine."
reveria.40.a: "Fascinating stuff"
reveria.40.b: "I have truly been touched by The Thought"

reveria.41.t: "The Faith of the State"
reveria.41.d: "With [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s recent conversion to the philosophy of The Thought, the fate of the state is now unclear. Will the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] enforce [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal beliefs upon the Reverians, or let them decide for themselves?"

reveria.42.t: "Wine for Lothane III"
reveria.42.d: "With the new alliance between Lorent and the Wexonard king Lothane III, the pressure of the emperor is off of Lorent's back. If this is to be kept that way, he should remain pleased. Perhaps a gift is in order."

reveria.42.b: "I have no time for this"

reveria.43.t: "Lorent Sends Wine"

reveria.43.b: "Considerate, but I have no time for this"

reveria.44.t: "Rogue Rouge Wine"
reveria.44.d: "[A01.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Lorent has sent a box of fine Lorentish rouge wine to Lothane III, but upon reading the letter attached to it, it has become clear that due to a misunderstanding, it has arrived at the court of Lothane III of Reveria instead of the court of Lothane III of Wex. What shall be done with this rogue bottle?"
reveria.44.a: "Call the herald and have him return the wine to Lorent."
reveria.44.b: "I love Lencori rouge wine!"

reveria.45.t: "Wex Returns Gesture"
reveria.45.d: "Lothane III of Wex has returned the gesture and has bestowed the Lorentish court with a decorative sword forged from Ironhill steel."

reveria.47.t: "The Mix Up"
reveria.47.d: "The herald sent to deliver the wine to Lothane III of Wex has misunderstood and delivered it to Lothane III of Reveria. Accidents happen, but to [A01.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s dismay, Lothane III of Reveria is refusing to return the wine!"
reveria.47.a: "This is a huge insult"
reveria.47.b: "I'll send another bottle"

reveria.48.t: "The Mix Up"
reveria.48.d: "The herald sent to deliver the wine to Lothane III of Wex has misunderstood and delivered it to Lothane III of Reveria. Accidents happen, and to [A01.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s relief, Lothane III of Reveria has sent the herald back with the wine."
reveria.48.a: "What a pleasant man, now deliver it to his namesake in Wex"
reveria.48.b: "What a pleasant man, send both Lothane IIIs a bottle!"

reveria.49.t: "The Second Bottle"
reveria.49.d: "[A01.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Lorent was so pleased with the returning of the misplaced bottle that they have decided to send us a bottle as well."
reveria.49.a: "Let's send [A01.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] some delicious Reverian fish."
reveria.49.b: "I guess both Lothane IIIs will be getting drunk tonight."

reveria.50.t: "Reverian Fish"
reveria.50.d: "[A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Reveria was so pleased with out second bottle, that they decided to send some of their famous Dragon Coast saltwater fish, how very considerate. And it's cooled with ice too!"
reveria.50.a: "Perhaps the Portroy Agreement will hold after all."

reveria.51.t: "Friends in Small Places"
reveria.51.d: "With relative peace returned to the region, relations between Small Country and Reveria are beginning to take form in other ways than just a military alliance. As Viswall dye is imported to improve Reverian clothing, Reverian fish is exported to fill halfling bellies. As the Reverian shipwrights aid the halfling merchants in making their ships extra fit to trade on the Middanroy, Small Country advisors aid the Reverians in striking good deals with mercenaries."

reveria.52.d: "With relative peace returned to the region, relations between Small Country and Reveria are beginning to take form in other ways than just a military alliance.

reveria.57.d: "The Reverian Succession crisis is best described as a struggle between the King Lothane III síl Rever, who is of advanced age, and the other branches of the dynasty.

However, they met fierce resistance from the Kobolds who had already massacred the Gnomes, and when Castan Ebonfrost's wars began few went to Drekiríki. \nThe kingdom was destroyed by 901 when the settlement at Oddansbay was finally overrun by the Kobolds, leading to refugee streams from Drekiríki to its brother kingdom Reveria, and back to Gerudia.\nNow it is the kobolds that have been conquered, and although the Drekiríki culture and kingdom are long gone, we can continue to honour our brothers by adopting a new name for our realm that represents that legacy."

reveria.73.d: "[Root.Heir.GetName] has been socializing quite a bit during their education.\nAs a result they have made a friend at their Gommo University.

reveria.77.d: "It seems like sending [Root.Heir.GetName] to the Gommo University of Drekiríki was a good idea, as [ROOT.Heir.GetSheHe] has befriended several teachers and students that are part of the Nobility.\nThis will surely be a boon to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] advantage during their reign."

reveria.81.d: "With the province of Lilroy (as named so by the Gnomes, in reference to the river that flows into it from the highlands north of there), firmly under our control, settlers have begun setting the fertile land and bountiful coastline.\nThe question at hand is whether we should let settlers displace the local Kobolds, and if so, should we stimulate Reverian or Gnomish migration?"

reveria.82.d: "The city and land of Chiddeburd, with Burd meaning crossing to the Gnomes and Chidde being of unknown origin to us, has been in Reverian hands for some time now, and racial tensions in the area need to be addressed as settlers quibble over land.\nShould [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] let settlers displace the local Kobolds, and if so, should we promote Reverian or Gnomish settling?"

reveria.91.d: "Before us stands the choice to Harmonize the largest religious group in our part of Southern Sarhal, the Tanibic group.\nThe Nakavy Avo, The Fangaulan and Noukahi Pantheon and even the Mother Akasik faith of Northern Sarhal worship similar gods and have a common origin and could be Harmonized as one into our philosophy.\n\nIs it worth the trouble though?"
reveria.91.a: "All ideas are assimilable"
reveria.91.b: "This is not worth the effort"

reveria.92.t: "The War for the Gnomish Pass"
reveria.92.d: "The declaration of war on Nimscodd, with the goal of reconquering our lost lands in the Gnomish Pass, has riled up the whole country. The land was lost in 1396, which means that the human veterans of that war are now too old to serve, but their descendants are not. Thousands of volunteers are ready to restore honour to their families and their people, some youngsters, but others have fought in the Lilac wars. The only veterans of the Nimscodd war of serving age left today are a handful of gnomes loyal to Reveria and and those that carry some elven blood. \nAmong the veterans who have joined the war effort we find Galmarr Vestrundar, who carries elven blood and was present at the siege of Royvibobb in the 1390's, his defense of the wall has gained him the nickname "Gnometosser", and he is eager to toss some more."
reveria.92.a: "To war!"

reveria.93.t: "The Nirhaunes of New Tefkora"
reveria.93.d: "The declaration of war on Eborthíl, with the goal of establishing control over the islands that once belonged to the Reaver Divenhal Kingdom, has revealed an unlikely ally; The ancient Divenori people and the noble house of Nirhaunes. When New Tefkora was lost to the locals in the 10th century, and the Taefdares lost the land to House Silebor many Gerudian landholders stayed behind and adapted to the new situation. The most prominent Gerudian house on the Isle of Tef ever since is house Nirhaunes, who gained New Tefkora as a fiefdom for helping Halfdal Divenscourge in his conquests.\nCenturies later Reavers in the East Divenhal sea had diverged so far from the Gerudians that they deserved their own name, the Divenori. These Divenori used to be in the majority on a couple of islands, such as New Tefkora, Ibtat and even Nathalaire, but now they dwindle in number every generation, as they are assimilated into the various cultures that now dominate their lands, but some are still left, and hope to see a return of ancient fiefdoms.\n\nThe Nirhaunes don't have much to offer as they have lost most of their land and wealth, nor were they informed of this war beforehand and thus had no time to plan, but they do have a wizard among their kin, and a small handful of men willing to fight or donate to the war effort."
reveria.93.a: "We welcome these Reavers of old!"

reveria.95.t: "[A05.GetUsableName] calls for aid"
reveria.95.d: "With the Religious War upon us, [A05.GetUsableName] has taken the lead of our faction, and is asking for aid in the war. How do we respond?"
reveria.95.a: "We will support with £mil£§YMilitary Power§!"
reveria.95.b: "We will support with £icon_manpower£§YManpower§!"
reveria.95.c: "We will support with ¤§YCrowns§!"
reveria.95.e: "We cannot offer our support at this time"

reveria.97.t: "Autorower Oars"
reveria.97.d: "The Autorower Oar is a Gerudian invention that allows a ship to forgo rowers in favor of sets of magically powered oars that give surprising speed and agility. This allows ships to have less crew, move faster, and Reave further.\n\nThey can even be attached to small rowing boats to allow for faster disembark speeds."

reveria.98.t: "Advanced Axepistols"
reveria.98.d: "The Advanced Axepistol is a term used to describe a plethora of designs ranging from small handaxes to large poleaxes, that all have in common that they are also a firearm.\n\nThrough the fusion of Gerudian culture and Gnomish ingenuity these weapons can be crafted with numerous additional features, such as scopes, detachable axeheads, loading-systems and more.\n No Reave is complete without one!"

reveria.99.t: "Weightless Holds"
reveria.99.d: ""Ever had to stop a Reave prematurely due to a lack of hold space? Is your Box of Holding just not cutting it? Get a Weightless Hold!"\n\nWhether lifted through balloons, fans, incantations, avian golems or any other way, a Weightless Hold is a ship hold that has been adapted to weigh very little, or even nothing at all. This usually involves turning the ships hold into a sort of loose gyroscopic room lifted up through magic or machine.\nThis allows Reavers and merchants to travel further and carry more cargo, making it a worthwhile addition to any Gerudians ship."

reveria.100.t: "Tale Generator"
reveria.100.d: "Long thought to be impossible, a group of Technomancers has managed to create a machine that can both read & create stories. The more it reads, the better its stories get.\nIt can help writers make their stories seem more professional, or create a new story altogether.\nOne can even attach an Automated Translator to it, allowing it to translate stories into foreign languages.\n\nIt is no wonder that this invention was made by followers of the Skaldhyrric Faith, as they know the value of stories and Tales like no other.\n\nWith this invention Skaldhyrric Tales can be reforged for different age groups, cultures and races, take into account contemporary parallels or fill in missing pages. It may not be the most authentic way to spread the Faith, but it surely is the most effective one."

reveria.101.t: "Proselytizing Advisors"
reveria.101.d: "Being a [ROOT.GetRulerReligion] Monarch with so many Gnomes around can be tiresome, especially if they keep bringing up The Thought.\nSometimes it gets so annoying [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] considers abolishing the Gnomish Co-Government, but at other times their proselytizing seems almost effective, especially when Human The Thought Converts chip in.\n\nIt does however occasionally get in the way of the work of the Advisors, and can also hinder [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] in their vital work. Should something be done?"
reveria.101.a: "[ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] will try to ignore it"
reveria.101.b: "You're all fired!"
reveria.101.c: "Rationalism, Progress, Sentience & The Theory of Everything... I am converted!"

reveria.102.t: "The Death of Lothane III"
reveria.102.d: "With the sudden death of Lothane III síl Rever, the Reverian Succession crisis reaches its apex, as pretender armies march for [ROOT.GetCapitalName] to depose [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] and claim the crown of [ROOT.GetUsableName].\n\nIn this time of peril, the powers that be decided to..."
reveria.102.a: "Accept the demands of House síl Rever-Stomer"
reveria.102.b: "Accept the demands of House síl Rever-Carver"
reveria.102.c: "Fight!"

reveria.103.t: "The House of síl Rever-Carver"
reveria.103.d: "With the diplomatic future of [ROOT.GetUsableName] secured, [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has appeased House síl Rever-Carver.\nThis should be enough for the House to be willing to attend a Thing, should we so desire."
reveria.103.a: "Most fortuitous"

reveria.105.t: "Second Age of Reavers"
reveria.105.d: "With the rediscovery of Aelantir, the increase in Cannorian naval trade and the reemergence of Reverian Reavers, we are truly in the Second Age of Reavers!"
reveria.105.a: "Reave, Raid, Pillage!"
