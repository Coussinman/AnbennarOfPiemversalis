The legacy of Lothane, the great conqueror, still echoes through the ages—his vision was clear: Wex would rule over all, unchallenged and supreme. It was Lothane’s ambition that set the course for our people, laying the foundation for the empire we are destined to build. Today, we carry that legacy forward, driven by the same iron will and determination.

To gain the upper hand, Lorent and Wex employed underhanded tactics, using cunning and subterfuge to weaken these formidable adversaries. Through their strategic maneuvering, they played a crucial role in shattering Dameria, leaving it in ruins.

AC5_remember_the_fall: "Remember the Fall"
AC5_remember_the_fall_desc: "The traitorous humans betrayed us during the fall of Khugdihr. They claimed to be fellow worshippers of Nimrith but were quickly turned by the Regent Court, and turned against us during the siege, which we shall never forgive nor forget. And not only they have done crime. The surface humans forced us into isolation for centuries, and then assisted the dwarves in invading us. We will forever remember. We shall ensure that they will never know peace again - Nimrith’s vengeful spirit shall forever haunt them, for we have not forgotten their past! Their spinelessness shall be their end!\n\nThe cruel dwarves attacked and killed us during the fall of Khugdihr. They murdered our people in cold blood, forced us to leave our homes and then their kin rejected us. They have shown time and time again that they will never accept us, and that we cannot coexist. We will forever remember. We shall ensure that they will never know peace again - Nimrith’s vengeful spirit shall forever haunt them, for we have not forgotten their past! Their obstinacy shall be their end!\n\nThe arrogant elves lurk on the surface, corrupting the humans with idiotic ideals of “peace” and “harmony”. They shall certainly not be spared either, for they incited the humans to attack us. The hypocrisy of supporting peace and harmony yet inciting attack! We will forever remember their transgressions. We shall ensure that they will never know peace again - Nimrith’s vengeful spirit shall forever haunt them, for we have not forgotten their past! Their arrogance shall be their end!"
AC5_heated_home: "A Heated Home"
AC5_heated_home_desc: "The Magmascale Kobolds spent most of their history being threatened by their enemies, whether among themselves or from the outside. Due to this, the kobolds were innovators in fortification and defense."
AC5_industrial_lavaforge: "Industrial Lavaforges"
AC5_industrial_lavaforge_desc: "The key reason the Zutarziran state held out for so long against hostile forces from all sides was its industrial capacity. The Magmascale Kobolds had constructed huge forges using lava as fuel, making them the strongest industrial power in the Serpentsreach. This advantage was further strengthened by their large population and well-defended urban centers.\n\nThe weapons and construction industries in Zutarzira were flourishing, granting economic security to the state and allowing the kobolds to properly hold their ground – their enemies would often be astounded at the quality of the Zutarziran army’s equipment. In times of peace, metal and obsidian-crafted exports allowed them to achieve relative prosperity, and during war, the Lavaforges ensured Zutarzira’s war machine would always keep more momentum than their enemies."
AC5_giant_anger: "The Cycle of Violence"
AC5_giant_anger_desc: "“Then they came. And there was so many of them, and their faces were so contorted with rage and hate. I didn’t understand why, though I would soon realize. I loaded my crossbow and shot one, who fell to the ground. Five more came, not looking back at their fallen friend. I shot another. They still didn’t look back. The instructors had promised us that the kobolds were cowardly and weak, but these weren’t. It was as if they were powered by some supernatural rage, something beyond my understanding. At some point they outran me, pushed me down while glaring and dragged me along with them after putting me in chains. After a while they began to appear calmer, but this was a facade: Once every few minutes or so their faces would flare up with rage and they would hit me. I recall at one point during the journey I tried to speak to them, but they hit me on the mouth until I was temporarily rendered mute.\nI believe this speaks volumes about the nature of our enemies. They must be exterminated and purged before they can harm another soul, for they have turned completely to madness.”\n\n-Writings of a Garnet officer"

AC5_firegrown_plants: "Fed by Fire"
AC5_firegrown_plants_desc: "The dwarves of Aul-Dwarov were fed by the farms of Tuwad-Dhumankon in addition to the Serpentsvale, while the Goblins and Orcs were fed by mushrooms and the various monsters they killed. However, this model of food production couldn’t work for Zutarzira due to their fiery environment, which meant that during times of war they experienced repeated famines and in times of peace they were hopelessly reliant on Bulwari and neutral remnant holds. Thusly, their scientists extensively experimented with bio-modifying plants to their benefit, in hopes of creating a stable food supply.\n\nHeat-resistant plants were created, and although these could be extensively grown, they lacked the nutrition of the other Serpentspine plants, rendering them essentially unusable. Therefore, the Zutarziran artificers experimented further. Eventually they got some plants to take in energy from heat, converting it to create nutrition. These plants could be reliably used to feed the large kobold population, and as such quickly spread throughout the Zutarziran domain. As a large variety of plants were modified to suit the Magmascale needs, Zutarzira could now maintain impressively high levels of food production and food security, despite having a large population in a hostile environment."

AC7_kryzzar_the_unifier_desc: "Kryzzar stands as the greatest Flamemarked Gnoll of recent memory, a warrior whose skill and cunning have no equal among his kin. Through sheer force of will and unrivaled prowess, he has achieved what many thought impossible: uniting the fractured tribes of the Flamemarked swamps under his singular rule.\n\nHis vision is as bold as it is terrifying. No longer content to languish in the mists and muck of Daravan's Folly, Kryzzar seeks to lead his pack beyond the swamps, striking into the heart of the Cannorian realms."
AC7_scavenging_lifestyle: "Scavenging Lifestyle"
AC7_scavenging_lifestyle_desc: "The survival of the Flamemarked Gnolls in the unforgiving swamps of Daravan's Folly hinges on their relentless resourcefulness and savagery. In this inhospitable land, they scour the ruins of a forgotten kingdom, scavenging anything of value—ancient tools, rusted weapons, and scraps of armor—to sustain their brutal way of life.\n\nYet scavenging alone is not enough. The gnolls lie in wait amidst the tangled foliage and murky waters, ready to pounce upon any unfortunate adventurers or wanderers who stray too far into the swamp.

AC7_swamp_dwellers_desc: "For centuries, we have called the swamps of Daravan's Folly our home, enduring its perils and mastering its secrets. What others see as an unlivable quagmire, we see as our dominion—a place where the land itself bends to our will.\n\nWe have adapted to the harsh environment in ways that no outsider could comprehend.

AC7_scarred_flesh: "Scarred flesh"
AC7_scarred_flesh_desc: "The Flamemarked Gnolls carry their devotion to the Xhazobkult and their brutal traditions on their very skin, engaging in ritual scarification through demonflame. These searing rites etch intricate patterns into their hides, each mark telling a story of pack affiliation, personal achievements, and unwavering allegiance to their dark faith.\n\nWhile their overall structure retains echoes of their Sandfang ancestry, the Flamemarked Gnolls are among the most peculiar of their kind. Their appearance is further set apart by a unique and unsettling adaptation: the removal of their fur. Living in the parasite-infested swamps of Daravan's Folly, they have adopted the harsh practice of using caustic unguents to strip their hides bare."

AC7_copper_swamp: "Copper Swamp"
AC7_copper_swamp_desc: "Daravan's Folly, while a treacherous and inhospitable swamp, holds immense value beneath its murky surface. Rich veins of copper run through the land, a resource the Flamemarked Gnolls exploit with ruthless efficiency.\n\nThose unfortunate enough to survive capture and avoid the sacrificial pyres are condemned to a grueling fate in the copper mines scattered across the swamp. Under constant watch, these captives toil endlessly, extracting the precious metal that fuels the gnolls’ ambitions."

AD2_great_migrations: "The Great Migrations"

Some of our ancestors fled eastward, where they endured enslavement under the centaur warlords of old.
