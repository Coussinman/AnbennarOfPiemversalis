 Z68_expand_the_port_title: "Expand the Port"
 Z68_expand_the_port_desc: "Toarnaire's port stands as the gateway to our ambitions, but if we are to rival the mercantile republics of the Winebay, it must become a hub of unmatched commerce and efficiency. Investments in expanding the port’s capacity and modernizing its facilities are imperative. Additionally, we must bolster our merchant fleet, both to secure the flow of goods and to safeguard our trade routes from those who would undermine our interests."

 Z68_curious_waters_title: "Curious Waters"
 Z68_curious_waters_desc: "Rumors persist of a lost elven continent hidden beyond the western seas, a realm of mystery and allure. Driven by curiosity and ambition, we should dispatch an expedition to navigate those uncharted waters and uncover the truth behind the tales. Such a venture could open up new trade routes, bringing wealth and prosperity, or perhaps even lead us to fertile lands where we could cultivate plantations of the finest wines."

 Z68_new_plantations_title: "New Plantations"
 Z68_new_plantations_desc: "The discovery of fertile lands across the western seas heralds a new opportunity for our realm. These untouched territories present an unparalleled opportunity to establish vast plantations, where the finest wines can be cultivated. Colonizing these lands will demand foresight, substantial resources, and skilled governance to ensure their prosperity and security. Yet, the potential wealth and influence to be gained far outweigh the challenges."

 Z68_bloodsuckers_title: "Bloodsuckers"
 Z68_bloodsuckers_desc: "The leechdens, a hauntingly mysterious region, are home to monstrous and alien creatures that evoke an eerie familiarity. Like the vampires of the Blood Court, these beings are drawn to the scent of blood, thriving in darkness and preying upon the living. Their strange and unsettling ways demand closer scrutiny."

 Z68_slave_barons_title: "Slave Barons"
 Z68_slave_barons_desc: "The Barons of Marrlliande, though cloaked in the guise of mortal aristocracy, are known to us for what they truly are—vampires who dare to carve out their own dominion, far from the authority of the Blood Court. These rogue Barons have established a fiefdom where they rule with unchecked power, flouting the delicate balance maintained by the Court.\n\nSuch defiance cannot be tolerated. Vampires ruling outside the Blood Court threaten the unity and order that protect our kind from the chaos of unrestrained ambition. We must act swiftly and decisively. Marrlliande must be brought back into the fold, its Barons reminded that their existence and authority derive from the Court's will."

 Z68_back_to_the_fold_title: "Back to the Fold"
 Z68_back_to_the_fold_desc: "The colonists of Isobelin, hailing from Toarnaire, have ventured far across the seas to establish a foothold in Aelnatir. Yet, these settlers are Roilsardi, bound by blood and heritage to our rule. Their attempt to forge an independent colony cannot be ignored, for such defiance threatens the cohesion of our dominion. Once subdued, their lands could be entrusted to the Barons of Marrlliande, reinforcing their loyalty to the Blood Court while granting them a strategic role in administering these distant territories."

 Z68_gather_support_title: "Gather Support"
 Z68_gather_support_desc: "If we are to break free from the boot of wineport, we must gather support from whoever we can. The aggressive trade policies of wineport has brought them many enemies, and we should use this to our advantage to gather support for our cause."

 Z68_poke_giant_title: "Poke the Giant"
 Z68_poke_giant_desc: "One of the old Roilsardi provinces are being helt by Lorent, and it won't be easy to take it back. As an influential imperial trading port, we possess leverage few others can wield. Our economic importance ensures that the Empire values our stability and prosperity. By aligning our interests with the Emperor’s and presenting the reclamation as a rightful restoration of Roilsardi lands, we could sway the imperial court to support our cause."

 Z68_wine_making_title: "The Bloody Roilsardi"
 Z68_wine_making_desc: "The idea of blending blood magic into our wine into new heights in the region and in the empire. The Roilsardi wine is already well-regarded, but with the infusion of blood magic, we can create a wine unlike any other, with distinct qualities that will intrigue the wealthy elite and trade markets alike. The dark allure of blood-infused wine could become a symbol of power, prestige, and mystique, elevating Toarnaire to new heights.\n\nHowever, the use of blood magic in the production process will need to be handled with great caution and secrecy. The practice could raise concerns and ethical questions, especially among those who may oppose the use of blood magic or view it as a corruptive force. To avoid backlash, it would be wise to conceal the magic behind a carefully crafted narrative—perhaps positioning it as a new \"ancient technique\" rediscovered in the region, known only to the most esteemed winemakers."

 Z68_finish_wineport_title: "Finish Wineport"
 Z68_finish_wineport_desc: "With the wealth and power we have accumulated, now is the time to seize the opportunity to unify Winebay under our banner and establish our dominance as the premier trading power in the region. Wineport, with its unparalleled influence and strategic location, stands as a symbol of the power we seek to claim for ourselves. Its position as the heart of trade and commerce in the Winebay makes it the perfect prize for our ambitions."

 Z68_blood_harvest_title: "Blood Harvest"
 Z68_blood_harvest_desc: "To craft the perfect wine, we must eliminate any obstacles standing in our way, and that includes the powerful competitors Rubenaire Red and Elisin Triros. Their wines are renowned and have a significant presence in the market, and we cannot allow them to remain a threat to our dominance in Winebay. By acquiring their lands and burning their wineries to the ground, we will destroy their production capabilities, eliminating both their influence and their ability to compete with our own. In the ashes of their vineyards, we will seize their trade secrets and harness them for our own gain.\n\nThe peasants who previously worked in their fields will be harvested for their blood, so that it may be used with blood magic to experiment new wine making techniques."

 Z68_scheme_wineport_title: "Scheme against Wineport"
 Z68_scheme_wineport_desc: "For our scheme against wineport to succeed, we must must know the inner workings of the city. We must gather information on the city's defenses and the loyalty of the city's subjects."

 Z68_final_touches_title: "Final Touches"
 Z68_final_touches_desc: "The time has come. Everything is in place for our declaration of independence from Wineport. Our spies have infiltrated the city, carefully gathering the intelligence we need to strike at its heart. We know its defenses, its secret passages. Our allies, both in the shadows and in the open, are ready to rise with us at a moment’s notice."

 Z68_own_path_title: "Our Own Path"
 Z68_own_path_desc: "With our freedom secured, the next step is clear: we will establish our dominance over the Winebay."

 Z68_remnant_title: "The Remnant"
 Z68_remnant_desc: "Saloren, the other Roilsardi remnant, stands as an obstacle to our ultimate ambition of uniting Roilsard under our rule. While we once considered independence from the Duchy, our ambitions have since grown—our vision has expanded beyond mere autonomy to the unification of all Roilsardi lands into a single, dominant force."

 Z68_duchy_reforged_title: "A Duchy Reforged"
 Z68_duchy_reforged_desc: "With the core lands of Roilsard firmly under Roilsardi rule once more, we have taken a significant step toward securing our dominance in the region. Though we have no interest in reforging the old Duchy, the return of these lands provides us with a powerful foundation to build upon."

 Z68_crimson_aristocracy_title: "§RCrimson Aristocracy§!"
 Z68_crimson_aristocracy_desc: "he nobles who stood by us during our struggle for independence now return, as we knew they would, to collect the debts we owe them. Their demands are bold, but not unexpected: the leadership of the realm must now pass into their hands. Their words, laced with a strange and unshakable power, carry an undeniable weight—one that we cannot ignore, nor fully resist. The air seems to hum with an unseen force, as though some deeper, arcane influence is subtly guiding our every thought and action.\n\nAs we listen to their demands, we feel a creeping sense of inevitability. The power behind their words isn’t just political; it’s something far more ancient and mysterious, §Rwe simply do not have the will to resist...§!"

 Z68_hemomancy_title: "§RHemomancy§!"
 Z68_hemomancy_desc: "With the new rulers of Toarnaire taking power, the ancient and forbidden arts of blood magic are no longer relegated to whispered legends and shadowy corners. The time has come to bring these dark practices back into the light, though they will not be available to the masses. Only a select few will be allowed to learn its secrets, hidden away in the deepest, most secluded chambers of Toarnaire’s castles and academies.\n\n But blood magic comes with a price. Its power is drawn from the life force of others, and the more one seeks to harness, the greater the cost. Only those of true ambition, those willing to sacrifice everything to seize greater power, will be granted access to its teachings."

 Z68_blood_to_wine_title: "§RBlood to Wine§!"
 Z68_blood_to_wine_desc: "Our hemomancers are hard at work, experimenting with new techniques to make blood magic a part of our wine production. The results are promising, and we are on the cusp of a breakthrough that could revolutionize the wine industry in the region."

 Z68_bloodwine_title: "§RBloodwine§!"
 Z68_bloodwine_desc: "At last, we have perfected our creation—a drink like no other, both intoxicating and brimming with power. Crafted through the union of traditional winemaking and the forbidden art of blood magic, it is indistinguishable from ordinary wine in appearance, yet its taste is unmatched, rich with a depth that no vineyard could achieve by conventional means. This new drink will be known as \"Bloodwine\".\n\nTo the world, the name will evoke thoughts of the fertile lands of the Bloodwine wineries. But for those within our inner circle, the name carries a deeper, darker truth—a truth known only to us. The secret ingredient lies not in the soil or the grape, but in the essence of life itself, carefully infused through ancient rituals of blood magic."
