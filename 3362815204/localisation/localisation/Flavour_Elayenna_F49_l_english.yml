F49_monstrosity_title: "Question of Monstrosity"
F49_monstrosity_desc: "If we are to build a great nation in Salahad we must make efforts to look inward and make efforts to transform how we govern into a more civilized model. We must be seen as equals if we are to survive."

F49_catching_up_title: "Catching Up"
F49_catching_up_desc: "We have capered about pillaging, looting, and kidnapping for centuries. We don't have the infrastructure or bureaucracy set up to run a civilized nation. We need to at least match our neighbors."

F49_worshipping_the_sun_title: "Worshipping the Sun"
F49_worshipping_the_sun_desc: "Although what was originally planned as a false conversion in order to preserve our sovereignty, Jasiene quickly became enamored with the desert elf Jaddar and faithfully converted herself and her people to this new faith. Now, as our nation is quickly adopting the ways of The Jadd, many still cling to our traditional huntress religion. This ancient religion can no longer be tolerated. We must make efforts to proselytize the light of Surael for the stability and unity of the realm."

F49_merchant_class_title: "Encourage Merchant Class"
F49_merchant_class_desc: "It is clear we cannot develop our nation with our treasury and resources alone. But an advisor has recently proposed a wonderful idea that could kill two Harimari with one stone. If we encourage the more entrepreneurial of our tribeswoman to invest in our projects, we could develop our country as well as our position as a civilized nation."

F49_ennoblement_title: "Ennoblement of Tribes"
F49_ennoblement_desc: "The time has come. Our stalwart ruler has a vision. Surael blesses us with his favor. And our nation has progressed into civilized society exponentially through our efforts. The last of the puzzle pieces must come together. We must present the Chieftesses of our land with an opportunity to become full-fledged nobility."

F49_the_desert_elves_title: "A Vital Alliance"
F49_the_desert_elves_desc: "The Desert Elves to our west marched into the Desert of Salahad with legions of cavalry. They are fierce, disciplined, and luckily for us, open to an alliance, as we have rescued a group of dying soldiers for breeding, which they received as goodwill. We must keep on their good side for the sake of our very independence."

F49_alliance_title: "The Desert Elves"
F49_alliance_desc: "With the marriage our Chieftess and Jaddar, friendly relations between Jadd and Elayenna have been secured, although this arrangement has been kept secret from their people. Still, their elven people know much more than us, and as we have recently converted to their faith "The Jadd", they may be willing to give us more aid in order to strengthen our realm and effectively spread Surael's light."

F49_powerful_secret_title: "A Powerful Secret"
F49_powerful_secret_desc: "Although our heir Jaddareesa's true identity as the love-child between the Elf Jaddar and our Chieftess Jasiene has been kept secret from the common people, she has begun to show incredible magical potential. For the safety of the realm, we must prepare somewhere she can learn her abilities to the fullest extent, as well as find a convenient diplomatic excuse to justify the inevitable vanishing of funds to the project."

F49_wonderful_gift_title: "A Wonderful Gift"
F49_wonderful_gift_desc: "Jaddareesa has shown an excellent understanding of both warfare, as well as her own magical abilities. One of her greatest contributions to our military was in the form of wards, powerful abjuration spells that greatly alleviate much of the trouble harpies have when protecting fortifications."

F49_controlling_life_title: "Controlling Life and Death"
F49_controlling_life_desc: "Jaddareesa loves her father, Jaddar, and Jaddar loves her, but there are many individuals in our realm wishing to see Jaddareesa leading the Jaddari legions into Bulwar, not least of all Jaddareesa herself. After all, it is her birthright to eventually show the harpies of the west the light of Surael, but Jaddareesa has been barred from her birthright, and with the lifespan of Harpies less than that of Elves, there is little hope of that dream becoming reality. However, Jaddareesa has noticed in her studies a certain magic, forbidden magic, that may be just what she needs to reclaim what is hers."

F49_desert_for_sands_title: "See the Desert for the Sands"
F49_desert_for_sands_desc: "We have created our home in the mountains and in the deserts. We have created beautiful hanging gardens, crafted marvelous glittering crowns, as well as cared and nurtured many desert oases. Few other civilizations could claim to have eeked out an existence as efficiently as the Siadunan Harpies. But we know longer wish to simply eek out an existence in Salahad. We need to produce abundance, both in food, metals, and trade goods. Our ruler, a talented and powerful mage, along with her mage advisors, have devised an incredibly ambitious plan. We will drain our ancestral home, deserts and hills of no consequence, and transfer that life energy to the more fertile Rahen Coast, using transmutation magic. We hope this solution will create abundance to feed, arm, and provide prosperity for our empire, although we will have to give up our sentimentality to our ancestral home, as it will take some time to return to its former self."

F49_true_heir_title: "True Heiress of Jaddari"
F49_true_heir_desc: "We have reclaimed what was stolen from us, what we were denied. We have taken our place as true heirs of Jaddari, and by extension, the Jaherian Empire, as we always should have been."

F49_plans_for_consolidation_title: "Plans for Consolidation"
F49_plans_for_consolidation_desc: "We have sat in our tiny roosts in the mountains for millennia until Jaher conquered and broke the Queendom of Siadanlen, and then we sat again until the Desert Elves of Jaddar enlightened our people. We will no longer sit around and wait for destiny to meet us. We shall meet it, in battle."

F49_caravan_city_title: "The Caravan City"
F49_caravan_city_desc: "Davharral to the South, the so-called "Caravan City", has been an excellent source of mates for our people, however it is time we take this city and finally have access to the coast, and Rahen..."

F49_silk_turbans_title: "Land of Silk Turbans"
F49_silk_turbans_desc: "The Raghamidesh people of Southern Rahen are largely merchants following the Silk Turban school of High Philosophy. They are quite adept at sea trade and have largely remained independent from the Raj. This will be their downfall."

F49_secure_trade_title: "Secure Trade in West Rahen"
F49_secure_trade_desc: "With the southern periphery of Rahen under our control, we may begin our efforts to monopolize trade in the West Rahen Gulf. After all, what is more civilized than mercantilism?"

F49_creative_diplomacy_title: "Creative "Diplomacy""
F49_creative_diplomacy_desc: "Our newer Harpy generations have been blessed with the beautiful and exquisite appearance of our elven mates while retaining the fierce and fiery spirits of our people. Because we may breed with any species and our attractiveness is largely universal, our Harpy "diplomats" are incredibly persuasive, and perfectly suited to further our nation's diplomatic interests abroad."

F49_an_offer_title: "An Offer from the Raja"
F49_an_offer_desc: "Our recent advances into Rahen both from the south and from the north, as well as our increased diplomatic presence in the Raj, have attracted the attention of the Raja. One of our scouts is reporting sight of an emissary only a few days journey from reaching our capital..."

F49_leech_title: "A Leech from Within"
F49_leech_desc: "As expected the Raj is a corrupt, counterfeit copy of what an empire should be. The Harimari and Raheni peoples can do little to stop our advances in Rahen. Like a leech we will suck Rahen dry."

F49_a_new_queen_title: "A New Queen in Town"
F49_a_new_queen_desc: "With the fall of the Raja, we are now the dominant position in Rahen, only rivaled by the Hobgoblins to the Northeast. We are the heirs to the Harimraj, which shall from this day forth be ruled by Harpies."

F49_a_jadd_matriarchy_title: "A Jadd Matriarchy"
F49_a_jadd_matriarchy_desc: "We have done more than Jaddar and his desert legion could ever have hoped to accomplish. Although they may have shown us the true faith of the Jadd, we will be the ones to shine its light on all corners of the world. We will create an empire ruled by Harpies in the name of the Sun, a matriarchy whose purpose shall be to mother the lesser races, and teach them the light of Surael."

F49_harpies_of_a_feather_title: "Harpies of a Feather"
F49_harpies_of_a_feather_desc: "Our sisters to the north used to be the same as our people in every way, a true family the Siadunan Harpies were. Unfortunately, we have progressed into the light through Surael and they have not. But we will not leave our sisters behind."

F49_hanging_cities_title: "Hanging Cities, Desert Gems"
F49_hanging_cities_desc: "The Crest of Ishtara and the Hanging Cities of the Siadunan Peaks are just a couple examples of the wonderful creations Siadunan Harpies can manifest. Our grand people and glorious culture will simply not be complete unless we are united."

F49_no_room_for_heroes_title: "No Room for Heroes"
F49_no_room_for_heroes_desc: "The Gold Dwarves of Verkal Gulen have holed up behind Hero's Gate for centuries, before our written or oral history even speaks. The Vale is rightful Harpy land, it is time we finally take it back."

F49_family_title: "Family vs Family"
F49_family_desc: "The Ghankedhen people of Northwest Rahen are well-known for their strong family bonds and close-knit people. It is here we shall begin our ventures into the north of Rahen. We will show them our family is simply better than theirs."

F49_connecting_our_lands_title: "Connecting our Lands"
F49_connecting_our_lands_desc: "We have expanded into Rahen through the mountains in the north and the coasts to the south. We have gained much fertile and resource-rich land, however our lands have become wide and our caravans and supply lines grow inefficient. We must connect the rest of our lands around the Paravimvata."

F49_tame_title: "Tame the Paravimvata"
F49_tame_desc: "Although we have made great developments around the Paravimvata Mountains and have solved our supply issues, our advisors have come up with an incredibly ambitious idea. We could create roads and tunnels directly through the mountains that only Harpies could conceivably make use of. This will provide great benefits for both civilian and military uses. It would take quite an amount of resources, however, or perhaps the talents of an incredibly powerful mage's transmutation magic..."

F49_salahad_harpy_unification_title: "Salahad Harpy Unification"
F49_salahad_harpy_unification_desc: "With the Harpies of East Salahad completely under our rule the necessity of their cultural integration is unquestionable. We must decide to pursue a gradual or immediate approach with our sisters."

F49_dove_title: "A Young Dove Comes Forth"
F49_dove_desc: "One of the chieftesses under us has been a strong proponent of Siadunan Harpy unification and has contributed much to our cause since we have begun to pursue our goals more aggressively. This chieftess has recently come to us with a most interesting tribute, a young Harpy maiden with an incredible gift for warfare."

F49_mining_title: "Mining the Paravimvata"
F49_mining_desc: "Since time immemorial we have lived next to the Paravimvata, but never have we been able to use its resources as we are today. While the western mountains are barren and desolate, the eastern mountains of Rahen are brimming with valuable minerals such as iron, copper, and even gold!"

#Events

elayenna.101.t: "The Jadd Matriarchy"
elayenna.101.d: "We have united the Siadunan Harpies, reclaimed our rightful place as Jaddar’s heir, conquered the decadent Raj, tamed the mountains we have roosted in for centuries, realized our full magical potential, and have set up a new capital and ensured prosperity for hundreds of years to come. Although we have the heritage of Jaher as well as Jaddar, we may now create our new empire in our image. We will unite the people of Rahen and the Salahad in the true light of Surael. We will become an empire ruled by the fundamentals of the Jadd and ruled by the sophistication of the Harpy race."
elayenna.101.a: "We declare ourselves a Queendom! To spread the light of Surael is our duty!"
elayenna.101.b: "Our current institutions will serve us well in spreading Surael's light."
elayenna.101.c: "We shall spread the light of Surael without abandoning our traditions."

elayenna.102.t: "Siadunan Harpy Consolidation"
elayenna.102.d: "We have successfully subjugated our uncivilized northern sisters, Siádan and Mulén. This moment has been long awaited in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], so much so that plans for this moment have been scarcely even considered. Our northern sisters, though we consider them our blood all the same, follow the old faith, which could hardly even be considered a faith. They practice songs and traditions passed down since the first Queendom. These traditions are ancient and antiquated. Eventually our sisters must be shown the light of Surael and adopt the true Jadd faith. But it must be decided whether we will adopt a strategy of gradual adoption or immediate enforcement."
elayenna.102.a: "Assure our sisters their local traditions will not be disturbed."
elayenna.102.b: "All will be civilized under the light of The Jadd."

elayenna.103.t: "Bloom and Rot"
elayenna.103.d: "\n\nMagic is a conduit, a conduit of encoded meaning. It is ambiguous, the ways it connects our conscious with our unconscious. It is a mystery. But not for all. For those born with powerful magical blood, especially those born with the privilege of available knowledge on how to harness it, magic is life and death; temporal and celestial; desire and fulfillment; and good and evil, opposites that laymen force apart, but forces we mages know are needed to forge the bridge of life and reality.\n\nWe, the Siadunan Harpies, are special. Whereas the civilized world has outlawed such practices as necromancy, and the monstrous world is ignorant to their abilities, we find ourselves in the middle. An area where we are intelligent enough to know our capabilities, yet without the magnanimity we know to be self-denial. \n\nThe Harpies of the former Siádan and Mulén are making progress. They are beginning to see the light of Surael, and they are adopting many of the Elven ways we have adopted. However, their most important contribution is yet to come.\n\nThe ceremony begins with a prayer, to Surael. His favor gives us success and his disfavor will cause our failure, our destruction, if we are in the wrong. Three drummers begin to play syncopated rhythms. The mages, only the best and brightest of our sisters, begin to dance around a shrine in the center of the courtyard, moving faster with the rising pulse of the beat. Our court mage, our most trusted advisor, draws sacred symbols in the dust with grain, wine, and traditional spirits.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] falls to the ground, convulsing for a moment before being helped back to her feet. She resumes the dance, moving differently now, and continues unfettered. She has allowed the magical energy to flow through her, her body a simple conduit for this powerful magic.\n\nWe begin the chant. A faint glow in [Root.Monarch.GetName], green with hints of violet, grows from a dim glow to a blinding light. The air begins crackling with electricity, singeing the robes and feathers of many in the ceremony. The flora around the courtyard begins to grow to gargantuan proportions, brighter, greener, more fertile, as the energy from our ancestral lands is siphoned into the courtyard and eventually the land all around us for miles, a land that will henceforth be known as Harpiel.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] faints, comforted, knowing this is just the beginning."
elayenna.103.a: "Soon this simple courtyard will be the very center of the world."

elayenna.104.t: "An Envoy from Dhenijansar"
elayenna.104.d: "One of our scouts has arrived at the court of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], bringing news of an emissary from Dhenijansar, on the Raja's behalf. She tells us he is accompanied by a contingent of honor guards, so the message must be nothing less than of paramount importance. She tells us that this emissary will arrive very soon."
elayenna.104.a: "Let us hope it is not a declaration of war."

elayenna.105.t: "Harpies on the Horizon"
elayenna.105.d: "The Harpies of Elayenna have expanded rapidly both to the northwest and the southwest. They do not seem to be slowing down and a number of our subjects have shown concern over a monstrous race expanding into the Raj, especially with the Hobgoblins breathing down our neck. A couple of our close advisors have suggested offering them the opportunity to become a Prabhi. Although this might damage the sanctity of our institutions, it will allow us to keep the Harpies in check."
elayenna.105.a: "This is the opportunity we need to limit their expansion."
elayenna.105.b: "We do not negotiate with monsters!"

elayenna.106.t: "An Offer from the Raja"
elayenna.106.d: "An emissary from Dhenijansar has traveled to our lands with an offer on behalf of the Raja. The Raja has taken notice of our aggressive expansion as well as our diplomatic presence in his domain. Although he dislikes the idea of negotiations with what he considers to be a monstrous people, he respects our might and capabilities nonetheless. He proposes a new arrangement between our nations. In exchange for becoming a Prabhi, the Raja would ensure the betterment of our image internationally. Although this seems like a good offer, many of our advisors are sure this is simply a way for them to leash us and exert their control diplomatically. However, still, there are those that note the numerous advantages of becoming a Prabhi."
elayenna.106.a: "Being close to the Raja can only aid our efforts in Rahen."
elayenna.106.b: "A bunch of tigers see *us* as monsters?!"

elayenna.107.t: "The Dwarves' Place in Elayenna"
elayenna.107.d: "As we recently conquered Hero's Vale, rightful Harpy land, we must now decide how to handle the Dwarves already living there. Technically The Jadd professes the equality of all races as long as they follow the light of Surael, however the Dwarves have historically been hostile to our people as well as isolationist and not willing to trade or engage in diplomatic relations. It is likely they will not be very happy with their forced integration. Ultimately the decision is up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
elayenna.107.a: "We shall attempt to integrate them, as long as they accept the light of Jadd."
elayenna.107.b: "The Jadd may proclaim the tolerance of all races, but I do not."

elayenna.108.t: "To Prabhi or Not to Prabhi"
elayenna.108.d: "Although accepting the Raja's terms of vassalge means we are at their wim much like the rest of the Raj, our unique cirumstances are such that we do not necessarily need to adopt *all* of the customs of the Harimraj. Although if we wish to ever become Raja ourselves, a lofty goal indeed, we will need to integrate ourselves more completely into their system. On the other hand, if we plan to simply dismantle the Raj, we can safely leave our current political institutions intact."
elayenna.108.a: "Let us not just adopt the title, but everything that comes with it!"
elayenna.108.b: "We will only perform what the Raja has requested, and nothing more."

jadd_matriarchy: "Jadd Matriarchy"
jadd_matriarchy_desc: "We have carved out a place for harpy-kind, a government in the deserts of Salahad that has vowed to a rule by women following the fundamentalist teachings of The Jadd."

siadan_harpy_empire: "Harpy Matriarchal Empire"
siadan_harpy_empire_desc: "We have carved out a place for Harpy-kind, a great nation in the deserts of Salahad. Our simple flock has been reorganised into a "Harpy Matriarchal Empire", a state where a legally privileged and empowered harpy class dominates the rest of society, with only Harpies allowed to hold the highest offices of government. Every instrument is held in the personal command of the Matriarch, and her will is law, for her will shall continue our ascent to dominance over the deserts we call home, and continued prosperity for the Harpy race."
siadan_institutional_harem: "Institutional Harem"
siadan_institutional_harem_desc: "One of the more important aspects of the harem is the advisory nature of the harem's members - and with the increased power of the Matriarch over all aspects of the state, this aspect has reached paramount importance. The most brilliant, cunning, intelligent and beautiful of our subjects are gathered around the Matriarch, ready and willing to provide sound counsel at a moment's notice. Be it in the bedchamber or the many baths, dining rooms, gardens and lounges of the Grand Harem at our capital, they have been instrumental in lending a helping hand to the governance of the empire."

# Events
elaienna.1.t: "Jaddar and Jaddarésa"
elaienna.1.d: "Jaddar Jexiszuir never knew his mother. Or that is how it seems, at least, as he never speaks of his birth amidst the Decade of Masks or his early life. His history only begins when he joined the Desert Legion, when he became part of the people that would one day bear his name. All he took from the Burned Empress was a last name, a birthright of Empires, and perhaps one another thing — a resolution his progeny would not have the same childhood as he.\n\nThat, at least, is what one would think seeing him with Jaddarésa, his daughter by Jasiéne Elaiennó. Almost three hundred years separates the elf and his harpy daughter. But seeing the duo cross the sands of the Salahad, the zealous elf laughing at a joke his daughter makes, as she dashes about against the deep blue sky, you would not think it. To see him teach her the bow, not a harpy's natural weapon, but one Jaddarésa studies with care. To see them talk late into the night by the fire, she asking piercing questions of Surael and His worship, questions only a child could or would ask, and him slowly and gently revealing to her the truths that were once revealed to him atop Ebbušubtu.\n\nOne of those truths is this: Surael's work is more than His crusade. The sun burns and scorches, but it is also the fuel for all that lives and moves on Halann. Jaddar is a man of passion, devoting every waking hour to that work. To some in Bulwar, that has made him a mad zealot. To some in Rahen, it has made him an implacable conqueror. But to Jasiéne? It has made him a devoted husband, despite the exigencies of leading a nomad legion.\n\nAnd to Jaddarésa? It has made her feel like she is the luckiest harpy in the world. The one with a father caring, doting, inspiring, who plays with her and teaches her and watches her grow into the woman she is becoming. And who truly, truly, believes she has a role in Surael's work that no one else will have, no one else could have.\n\nThe years stretch out before Jaddarésa, as she prepares for the role of Harpy matriarch — and Jadd Priestess — she was born to. There will be heathen clans to subdue, latent magical powers to train, truths to explore. But for now, under the shining light of Surael, there is only a daughter and her father, and that is enough."
elaienna.1.a: "Their smiles together are as bright as the sun."
