The city has gained its name from the ascended Nathalyne and since then it has been a haven of criminality and under-handed activities.

eoa_cities.13.t: "Bal Ouord"
eoa_cities.13.d: "Bal Ouord was built by the dwarven Balgar the Builder and it was meant to serve as a fortress to defend Castanor from future Gnollish Incursion. Sadly not even such a fortress could withstand demonic forces of natures like the Xhazobine which have besieged or bypassed the fortress multiple times. Nevertheless the fortress has still helped Ourdia to survive the Goblintide. Now that the fortress lays under our control it will serve as our first line of defense against any threat stemming from the Deepwoods, Serpentreach and Bulwar."

For centuries, the Moon Elves have kept to themselves, shunning the political affairs beyond their enchanted forest. However, with the rise of the Empire of Anbennar and their conversion to Regent Court, they have chosen to join its ranks.\nRenowned for its exquisite architecture, Ibevar is a place where moonlight filters through the silver leaves, casting an ethereal glow over the city. It is not just the beauty of the city that captivates Cannor, but also its formidable elven archers which will fill the ranks of the imperial army."

eoa_cities.16.d: "Escin served as a capital of Chivalric Kingdom of Farraneán, which was founded by Martin Farran during the War of the Sorcerer-King. Farraneán originally consisted of the plain of Whistlevale. Though granted de-jure to Ibevar in the Treaty of Anbenncóst, the young elfrealm had no presence within Whistlevale, and the Cursewood was in a mostly bloodless revolt against Ibenion's rule. Martin, too, claimed that he had a better claim to the region, as he had settled years before Ibenion had refounded the lost Cardesti city of Vardoced and laid down his foundations. "
